*INV:	What is this?

*MOT:	But maybe because of the computer she seems pretty, blasé.
*MOT:	Except for those hot pink shoes.
*MOT:	Someone had fun coloring that in.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	But, yeah.
*INV:	Okay.
*INV:	Good.

*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	Have to talk to management.
*MOT:	But no.
*MOT:	I dunno.
*MOT:	I'm trying to think of where this would, where you'd even see something like this.

*MOT:	Maybe like a little advertisement or something ⌈something cutesy⌉.
*INV:	Oh                                             ⌊okay⌋.

	   ⌈around there⌉.

*MOT:	He doesn't even really look real because he's like, a photograph of a photograph or something so.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	Um, yeah I dunno.
*MOT:	It's hard to see (be)cause he's +...
*MOT:	You don't see a lot of the details on like as far as like his eyes and things.

*INV:	Uh                        ⌊huh⌋.

*INV:	Okay.
*MOT:	He's expecting some big bang to go.

*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	I'm into legs today apparently but.
*MOT:	Either[?] his belt, is belted pretty low.
*INV:	Mm.
*MOT:	But yeah this seems like it'd be a drawing from like a from an old
	time Wriggling Wriggly or Ringly brothers ⌈or Barnum and Baily
	(be)cause it kinda has that cutesy little⌉, ⌈look to it⌉.
*INV:	                                          ⌊Oh⌋, okay.

*INV:	Okay, great.
@G:	Elephant
*MOT:	Oh an elephant.

*MOT:	(Be)cause it's kind of a cute little drawing.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	Seems, seems like he's an older elephant with all the wrinkles.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	I was gonna say baby.
*MOT:	But seeing all the wrinkles it seems like it's an older elephant.
*MOT:	His ear looks like it's been through a lot.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	Maybe one that's out in the wild or something too.
*MOT:	I don't know though.
*MOT:	Maybe.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	What more can you tell me?
*MOT:	Um he's got big toenails.
*MOT:	Um, I dunno.
*MOT:	He just seems big and, he's like slow.
*MOT:	Maybe because of all the wrinkles and stuff.
*MOT:	But he just seems like, that maybe some like-well I mean I dunno.
*MOT:	Hard to tell like if he would be one that you find at the zoo or out in the wild.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	But, (be)cause there's no background to it.
*MOT:	I'm going with he's out in the wild because of very little ears.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	Anything else?
*MOT:	Uh, his trunk is curved up but he doesn't have any food or anything in it.
*MOT:	So he's just kinda-maybe he's just keeping it out of his way when he walks.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	Looks like he's just kinda headin(g)out somewhere.
*INV:	Okay great.
@G:	Cake
*MOT:	Ooh cake.
*MOT:	This looks like that cake that my mother-in-law makes me every time I see her.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	Um, yes.
*MOT:	Chocolate.
*MOT:	Well yellow cake with chocolate frosting.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	It's funny though it looks like the piece is falling towards it +...
*MOT:	Usually you would see it like either standing upright.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	So it's kind of an interesting angle.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*INV:	Huh.
*MOT:	This seems like more the angle it was but it looks like someone changed the perspective on it or something.
*MOT:	Or just like out of the classic way you would see a piece of cake.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	But ⌈yeah⌉.
*INV:	What more can you tell ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	I dunno.
*MOT:	It seems like it might +...
*MOT:	This since being a drawing it seems like it came out of a picture book or something.
*MOT:	More the-uh-(be)cause I don't think like cookbooks +...
*MOT:	Usually you see a whole cake.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	But maybe they'd show a piece of a cake in a +...
*MOT:	But, the frosting looks fairly yummy.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	They didn't put enough in the middle though.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	You can tell there's it's just a thin layer here.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	That's sad.
*INV:	Can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	Uh, no.
*MOT:	Just seeing a big triangular, shape in here.
*MOT:	They little rec-they kinda stand out the little rectangles in the, thing.
*MOT:	But, mm it does seem like it's twisted perspective.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	So, yeah.
*INV:	Okay great.
@G:	Broccoli
*MOT:	Broccoli.
*MOT:	We used to call these trees when I was a kid.
*MOT:	So this, it's hard to tell.
*MOT:	It looks like it was maybe a photograph, of the broccoli (be)cause of the shadow behind it.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	But, it doesn't look very yummy.
*MOT:	It's kinda like the lobster where the photographs kinda diminished any of the good looking qualities to it.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	It's basically a like a stalk of broccoli and that's about as far as you're gonna get.
*INV:	What more can you tell me?
*MOT:	Um, well the stem looks pretty big compared to the top.
*MOT:	Maybe (be)cause of the perspective again.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	Oh it but, um, yeah.
*MOT:	It does look like a tree.
*MOT:	That's why we called them trees.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*INV:	Okay, good.
@G:	Horse
*MOT:	A little pony.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	And this definitely looks like a pony because his little mane is very short.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	He's got stocky front legs though.
*MOT:	What is this leg thing I got goin(g)?
*MOT:	What's up with that?
*MOT:	But, this looks like it's out of a drawing once again from like a picture book or something.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	A little hand drawing.
*MOT:	Looks like it's windy.
*MOT:	His tail is blowing a little.
*INV:	Oh okay.
*MOT:	He's kinda looking over to see, who's disturbing him.
*MOT:	He's got nice eyelashes.
*INV:	Mm.
*INV:	What else can you tell  me?
*MOT:	His legs really look odd.
*INV:	Huh.
*MOT:	Like they look +...
*MOT:	I'm not an expert but +...
*MOT:	It's maybe or maybe (be)cause he looks so tiny up here.
*MOT:	I dunno.
*INV:	Oh, uh huh.
*MOT:	They seem kinda extra thick, to me.
*INV:	Hm.
*MOT:	Not that I'm a horse expert but.
*MOT:	He looks very perky (be)cause his little ears are stuck up like he's just-he's listening hard.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	See.
*MOT:	Um, he's cute.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	Anything else?
*MOT:	Mm-mm [= no].
*INV:	Okay good.
@G:	Popcorn
*MOT:	Ooh a bowl of popcorn.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	I'm trying, it almost looks like there's like red, um, licorice in there or something.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	I think it's just the way the light is.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	In the, thing.
*MOT:	But um, yeah it just looks like a little bowl of popcorn.
*MOT:	Waiting to be eaten.
*INV:	Mm.
*MOT:	Looks like it's buttery.
*MOT:	It's so yellow.
*MOT:	It is funny the way the photograph is.
*MOT:	Ther- I do see like little red bits.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	You think +...
*INV:	Huh.
*MOT:	It looks like there's other kind of candy or somethin(g) in there.
*MOT:	But in a glass bowl.
*MOT:	The better to see what you're eating I suppose.
*MOT:	Um, I'm going with it's microwave popcorn.
*INV:	Can you tell me more?
*MOT:	No except for the glass, kinda magnifies some of the pieces down in here.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	They look a little, uh, distorted.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	Some pieces look a little bit bigger than others.
*MOT:	Uh, it's a nice little mound.
*INV:	Okay, good.
@G:	Alligator
*MOT:	Ooh, I always forget if it's like a crocodile or an alligator.
*MOT:	I think it's a crocodile.
*INV:	Okay.
*MOT:	But he does not look very nice.
*MOT:	He looks like he's goin(g) after something, over here.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	And I don't even know if he's even going after it to eat.
*MOT:	Or if he's just snapping at something to back away.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	But, the way his mouth it doesn't +...
*MOT:	I don't know.
*MOT:	It seems like if he was going to eat something he'd be more forward but.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	Tell me more.
*MOT:	Big red tongue.
*MOT:	Um, it's kinda funny (be)cause the +...
*MOT:	This the way this arm is drawn you don't see much shoulder but the
	way the perspective +...
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	It it seems a little off perspective-wise too because it looks like his other elbow must be way up high.
*MOT:	(Be)cause this isn't poking up as much on this side.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	Do they really have five, like five claws on the front and maybe three in the back?
*INV:	Hm, I'm not sure.
*MOT:	Wait, now he's got lots of ridges.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	He definitely looks like he'd be really scaly.
*MOT:	And you wouldn't want to touch him.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*INV:	Anything else?
*MOT:	Not that, no I just wouldn't want to meet him, I don't think.
*INV:	Okay, great.
@G:	Orange
*MOT:	Um an orange.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	A photograph of an orange.
*MOT:	Um, yeah the light on it's kinda funny (be)cause it makes it look real shiny.
*MOT:	But if it was an advertising orange it'd have a little drop of water on it.
*MOT:	So this just makes me think it's just a photograph of an orange.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	But you get some interesting shading behind it (be)cause of the light.
*MOT:	Um, yeah it looks nice and shiny.
*MOT:	Waitin(g) to be eaten.
*INV:	What more can you tell me?
*MOT:	Uh I don't know.
*MOT:	They were giving free oranges away at the Y for membership week.
*INV:	Oh wow.
*MOT:	So I took one.
*MOT:	It's still on my desk.
*MOT:	Uh, I dunno.
*MOT:	He's got like a little ridge in it, over here.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	Kinda breaks up the smoothness but.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	Little bit of sunshine with the light there.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	But yeah.
*INV:	Okay, good.
@G:	Cereal
*MOT:	A bowl of cornflakes.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	It's funny that it's like in the yellow bowl (be)cause it just kinda all looks so blah.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	Kinda like cornflakes.
*MOT:	Doesn't even have the milk to zaz-jazz it up.
*MOT:	It's just, sitting there.
*MOT:	Um, yeah this just looks like a photograph that someone took.
*MOT:	Once again not necessarily for like an advertisement (be)cause
	obviously it doesn't +...
*MOT:	To me it doesn't look appetizing but, ⌈&=whipers who am I⌉?
*INV:	                                      ⌊Mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	It's a thick bowl.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	It's kinda funny.
*INV:	What else can you tell me?
*MOT:	Um, I dunno.
*MOT:	There's a lot of cornflakes there.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	It's bothering me that there aren't any cornflakes up in here to
	make it ⌈a nice follow around⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊Oh⌋.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	Um +...
*INV:	Anything else?
*MOT:	Can't think of anything.
*INV:	Okay, great.
@G:	Football Player
*INV:	What is this?
*MOT:	Oh it looks like a female football player.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	That's cool.
*MOT:	Um, this just looks like a computer, generated thing.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	She's number three.
*MOT:	She plays for some team that starts with a W.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	The Whalers.
*MOT:	Because of the blue and white.
*MOT:	I dunno.
*MOT:	Um, yeah she's getting ready to throw the football.
*MOT:	So she looks like she's a quarterback.
*MOT:	Um.
*INV:	What more can you tell me?
*MOT:	Yeah this just looks like I dunno one of those computer generated deals.
*MOT:	So it's surprising actually that they have one with a f-a girl.
*INV:	Oh.
*MOT:	(Be)cause you wouldn't think that would be a standard &=yawns thing.
*INV:	Uh huh.
*MOT:	Excuse me.
*MOT:	She looks pretty young.
*MOT:	But I mean it's a computer thing so it's hard to tell.
*INV:	Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	But, this foot looks a little small.
*MOT:	How could she stand on that foot?
*MOT:	But no she, it just looks like a girl quarterback.
*INV:	Anything else you wanna say?
*MOT:	No.
*INV:	Okay.
*MOT:	       ⌈The end⌉.
*INV:	That's ⌊it⌋.
