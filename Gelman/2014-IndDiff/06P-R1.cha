@G:	Old Woman
@Types:	cross, narrative, TD
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	so that is an old lady.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] what more can you ⌈tell me⌉?
*MOT:	who is holding a                ⌊cane⌋.
*MOT:	so looks like she needs some help walking.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but she seems rather well dressed, and, yeah.
*INV:	can you say a little bit more?
*MOT:	um, she, looks like she might be of Indian descent.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and ⌊she⌋, looks like she wants to be younger than she really is.
*INV:	&=laughs ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	um and I'd be worried about her walking because her glasses seem
	rather thick too ⌊so⌋, ⌈looks like she needs some assistance⌉, ⌈in
	that regard⌉.
*INV:	                       ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	                                                               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	&=laughs okay.
*MOT:	anything else?
*INV:	we can move on.
*MOT:	okay.
*INV:	&=laughs.
@G:	Butterfly
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that would be a monarch butterfly.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	so, um, it's, looks like the picture was supposed to be done when it was alive so it doesn't look like a dried one.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, and he looks pretty intact.
*MOT:	most of the ones I've seen either use losing antennae or something.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	they're falling apart.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but looks like he's pretty full grown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and, all of his wings are perfectly fine so he looks kinda fake
	&=laughs.
*MOT:	I suppose, butterflies aren't that perfect looking, &=laughs so.
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	um, looks pretty realistic cause he's got all fuzzy on his body which is kinda gross looking.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	yeah that's about, it for him.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Parrot
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that is, probably a parrot but could be ⌈some other species of
	exotic bird⌉.
*INV:	                                        ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	um, so he probably can be taught to talk.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	though, I don't know if this one can talk.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um given he's paper he probably can't.
*MOT:	um, he's very colorful.
*MOT:	he looks a little chunky to me, for a bird.
*MOT:	um and his tail's rather [?] short so maybe they cut part of the tail off.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	he's [?], looks like he wants to talk.
*MOT:	he's saying something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	uh.
*INV:	anything else you wanna tell me?
*MOT:	his colors are symmetrical from the top to the bottom.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, and hopefully the rest of the stick is extending somewhere and
	he's not gonna fall &=laughs.
*MOT:	he's sitting on a stick that's not supported by anything.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	but hopefully that's just the drawing and.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	that's about it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
@G:	Ballerina
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a ballerina.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	she's wearing a tutu.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and, she is dancing.
*MOT:	and probably ruining her feet, &=laughs in those shoes, and messing up her legs.
*MOT:	and, and we have Firstname in a dance class where the girls do not
	wear tutus because it just distracts them from actually learning how
	to dance ⌈as opposed to⌉, ⌈being all concerned about how they look
	and⌉, whatever so.
*INV:	         ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	                          ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	hm, I'd like to hear more what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um, so, she looks rather thin, ⌈hopefully not becoming anorexic⌉.
*INV:	                               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋ &=laughs.
*MOT:	um, and, but she looks to be having fun.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, so.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Ice Cream
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	an ice cream cone.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	looks like it's strawberry flavored which is not my favorite.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	so it looks like an okay strawberry or ice okay ice cream cone but not really, it's not anything I'd wanna eat right now.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um, but fortunately it is getting warm enough, ⌈to finally be able
	to go out for ice cream⌉, so.
*INV:	                                               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	that's something we do a lot as a family.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	especially with the boy being so young and, ⌈there's not a lot you
	can do with⌉, three kids.
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they all like to go out <and eat> [?] ice-cream so we'll do that a lot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] tell me more.
*MOT:	and, this one looks like it's just about to start melting.
*INV:	                     ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	it's not quite dripping yet but it looks like it needs somebody to
	lick it or it will ⌊be⌋.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um, it looks like the Baskin_Robbin one scoop with nothing more.
*MOT:	so it's better to <go to> [?] xxx [= ice cream parlor] where you actually get more ice cream.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um, and that's just a bought sugar cone which a home-made waffle one's much better.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Pineapple
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that is a pineapple.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	grown somewhere, either Hawaii or maybe Central America.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and, so I've been to Honduras before ⌈and had fresh pineapple⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and so the pineapple here in the States is absolutely disgusting.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	and the stuff in the can is even worse.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but there's nothing like a fresh pineapple.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um so hopefully this one wasn't shipped and been sitting somewhere for awhile cause then it won't be as good as one that was just cut, ready to eat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], ⌈what more can you tell me⌉?
*MOT:	               ⌊um⌋.
*MOT:	but this one probably is an old one cause its leaves are all dried at the ends.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so it's looking pretty, old.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, but relatively normal shaped.
*MOT:	and, it'd be a good snack for a bunch of people.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], &=laughs okay.
@G:	Cat
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that is a cat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	he is looking like he's about to pounce on something.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	looks like he is looking at something and, the way his paw is perched, he's trying to be quiet and watch whatever it is before, he goes and gets it.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	he's, looks like a tabby sort of cat, which are better in terms of house cleaning.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	the amount of hair you gotta clean up after them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but, um, and he looks kinda like a nice cat.
*MOT:	I'm not a real cat person.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	most cats have attitudes.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	he's, he may be reasonable.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	so, &=laughs um, let's see.
*MOT:	he looks like he's probably an outdoor cat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but I can't tell if he's got claws or not.
*MOT:	but he looks pretty thin like he runs around and he's not sitting
	around, all day lounging in the living room, &=laughs ⌈in the sun⌉.
*INV:	&=laughs                                              ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	so, and he might be, he looks like a young cat.
*MOT:	he's probably, a few years old as opposed to being, five or six.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	but he looks like he's not he's out o(f) kitten stage.
*MOT:	looks like his legs are long enough that he's not quite a kitten anymore.
*MOT:	but not too much.
*MOT:	cute cat.
*INV:	&=laughs okay.
@G:	Judge
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that looks like a judge.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	who is either listening to somebody intently.
*MOT:	but it looks like he's listening about to say something and he's not
	happy about whatever he's listening, ⌈to⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	um, he's trying to look a bit stern.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	like he's in charge.
*MOT:	um, and he's trying to look at something far away cause he's old enough that he's now lost his, nearsighted vision so he needs glasses but not to see what he's trying to look at and so he's taken his glasses off.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	he's got something in the background and I can't figure out what it is.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	looks like a picture frame except doesn't have a picture on it.
*MOT:	so it looks like maybe some, door that things get passed to him or something.
*MOT:	I can't tell what that is.
*INV:	hm you know I'm not sure either.
*MOT:	and, ⌈he's got a book on his desk which seems kinda weird⌉.
*INV:	anything ⌊else⌋ you +...
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	that if it's a courtroom you don't really need books sitting on your desk.
*MOT:	maybe this is a desk in his office.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but.
*INV:	okay anything else you want to say?
*MOT:	mm the binding of the book is kinda weird being red.
*MOT:	most books, law books and other things are more of a darker color than that.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so, it kinda looks staged &=laughs.
*MOT:	I wouldn't have made it a a red book.
*MOT:	I would have made it either burgundy or black.
*INV:	hm okay.
*MOT:	to be more realistic, book ⌈that he'd probably be reading⌉, or
	needing to reference.
*INV:	                           ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
@G:	Muffin
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that is a muffin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	with some sort of oatmeal, coating on top.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and, that looks like it's probably a blueberry muffin, cause the dark spots seem to be a little bit, they're no longer formed.
*MOT:	so a raison would still be, formed and, ⌈um⌉.
*INV:	                                        ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	could be a chocolate chip muffin too I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and there appears to be something a little bit of red on it also, which maybe is some strawberry flavoring or something.
*INV:	             ⌈tell me more⌉.
*MOT:	um, it looks ⌊old⌋.
*MOT:	it does not look appetizing &=laughs.
*MOT:	um Starbucks could do better &=laughs.
*MOT:	and, yeah it's kinda looks like it's pulling from the paper which also means it's probably been sitting out for awhile and a little bit drying up.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so it's, and it would be a mess if you tried it t- feed it to little kids cause the crumbs would get everywhere.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	so, I really wouldn't want a muffin like this.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	give me something bite-sized to feed the kids.
*INV:	&=laughs okay.
*MOT:	I'd be telling them to, get their head over the table.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so that crumbs got on the table.
*MOT:	and they wouldn't listen and half would end up on the floor.
*MOT:	so, it's not a muffin I'd be interested in having.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
@G:	Dolphin
*MOT:	so this is a dolphin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	in the ocean.
*INV:	what +...
*MOT:	pardon?
*INV:	I'm sorry what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	it's, jumping.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it's at the beginning of it's jump.
*MOT:	or it's gonna end up with a bellyflop, whichever.
*MOT:	hopefully it just got out of the water.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, though it doesn't look like the water, is made so it looks like it comes out of it.
*MOT:	um, he looks full grown.
*MOT:	and so he's in the ocean he's probably not in Sea_World or anything like that so he's probably a wild dolphin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and um.
*MOT:	&=laughs they've found me [= referring to CHI opening door].
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um I don't know I've had dolphin before and it's very good meat.
*INV:	oh really?
*MOT:	um, and, I've done a research project before on the acoustics of dolphins.
*MOT:	they're very smart animals.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so, they're.
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	he looks like he's looking at something but I don't, know what he's looking at.
*MOT:	so maybe he's looking at a ship that's out in the sea cause he seems
	to be looking out and not down, ⌈where he would be entering the
	water so⌉.
*INV:	                                ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	and I'm not seeing any other dolphins with him which is kinda weird
	cause usually you see other, ⌈dolphins around him but⌉, he seems to
	either the person didn't draw it or he's kinda lost.
*INV:	                             ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋ &=laughs.
*MOT:	so hopefully he's, they're all more interior to the picture and he was the most posterior dolphin jumping.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	               ⌊so⌋, he's a pretty normally proportioned dolphin.
*INV:	&=laughs.
@G:	Pumpkin
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that's a pumpkin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and Firstname thinks they're or they're fruit cause pumpkin pie is
	sweet &=laughs.
*MOT:	she just said.
*MOT:	so, um, so I guess I'll have to make some pumpkin pie so she can see that it's not sweet before you, add all of the sweetener.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um this one is very long and tall.
*MOT:	it wouldn't be one that I would pick in a pumpkin patch, ⌈because it
	would make a very weird looking jack_o_lantern⌉.
*INV:	                                                         ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	I like more round-faced jack_o_lanterns.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	he'd look a little bit long-faced and maybe a little bit scary.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	but he's very perfect.
*MOT:	so, pumpkins usually aren't that perfect looking.
*MOT:	this one looks like it's been waxed even it's so shiny, and cleaned off.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but it was picked awhile ago cause the stem's brown.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so it's dried out, um.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	uh, it's hard to tell if it's a big one or a small one.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	(be)cause it could be either.
*MOT:	um, yeah it's full of seeds.
*MOT:	more seeds than probably anybody wants to eat so it's nice to dry some of them but you usually end up with ten times the seeds than you need.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	anything else you wanna tell me?
*MOT:	I think that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Firefighter
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	now this is a fireman.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I don't know what he's doing exactly.
*MOT:	I guess there's some gear, that's attached to the water or something
	⌈that he's⌉, adjusting.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and he's got gloves on and his whole outfit.
*MOT:	it looks like the fire's behind him so it looks like a pretty bad fire.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and so he looks pretty high up there on his ladder and, relatively stable but not incredibly stable.
*MOT:	doesn't looks like the rungs are, round which seems kinda weird,
	⌈for seems like your foot would slip on them⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	he's looking at something, which doesn't appear to be the direction at which the water's going.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so maybe he's trying to move the water that way.
*MOT:	and he doesn't really appear to be very concerned.
*MOT:	he looks he doesn't &=laughs his facial expression doesn't really
	seem to fit the picture, &=laughs in that he seems to be just
	happily being Mister Fireman while the world is burning around him.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	but um, so maybe he's got a lot of other buddies that are helping out.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	things are more under control than it appears in the picture.
*MOT:	but, he's kinda smiling and I don't think anyone looks like that
	when they're fighting a fire &=laughs.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Cracker
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that is a cracker.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um which also looks like relatively old cracker or ⌈a smashed
	cracker⌉.
*INV:	                                                   ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	some of its, parts have been, smashed.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and, I don't know if it has salt or not.
*MOT:	I don't really see any of the salt on it so.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it might be saltless or at least ⌈not have salt on the outside⌉.
*INV:	                                 ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	these also smash up and are crumbly and make messes &=laughs.
*MOT:	but this actually looks good.
*MOT:	of all of the food, I could handle a cracker right now.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um and the outside's relatively intact and all of its circles are where they're supposed to be so.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	this one looks more like it's maybe smashed in the bag but not, not demolished now that it's been out of the bag.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um and the coloring is, it's rather yellow.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	it's probably a little bit too yellow.
*MOT:	it almost looks margeriney.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, yeah but it's not too overcooked.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] okay.
@G:	Skunk
*MOT:	oh.
*INV:	&=laughs what is this?
*MOT:	there's a skunk.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they stink.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	and the air stinks forever after they've done their thing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um but they're rather cute.
*MOT:	and so the trail of the skunk in Bambi is very different than
	reality &=laughs.
*MOT:	flower is very cute.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, I don't think I've really ever seen too many skunk in my life.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I don't think people usually see them we just know that they've been there.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	I'd like to hear more what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	it's, um, this one looks to be probably a full-grown one.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	he doesn't look too small.
*MOT:	and he's a rather attractive one.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	(be)cause of his coloring.
*MOT:	um, but at the same time I wouldn't trust it cause it probably has rabies and if it bites you you'd end up, getting rabies.
*MOT:	so that wouldn't be good.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, yeah, I think that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	for him.
@G:	Race Car Driver
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that is a racecar driver.
*INV:	                    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	I don't know who he ⌊is⌋.
*MOT:	um I don't know where he is.
*MOT:	could be the Indy_Five_Hundred or some place like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, he's very happy.
*MOT:	it looks like the race hasn't started yet cause he's looking rather clean and just, whatever.
*MOT:	but ⌈since he's looking so relaxed maybe it's a couple days before
	the race cause he wouldn't really be looking that before the race⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	he'd probably be, getting ready and being a little bit more, focused.
*MOT:	so he looks like he's posing for his, his fans.
*MOT:	but at the same time there's all the people in the stands so I guess something's gonna happen.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	there's a bunch of people on around the other car.
*MOT:	so maybe they are just about to start a race.
*MOT:	or maybe it's qualifying and he's already qualified so he's gonna drive it but he's not worried about how he does in it.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um, yeah I'm not sure what all those other people are doing.
*MOT:	they seem to be, sort of checking out the car but they don't really to looking, like they're looking at anything particular on the car.
*MOT:	um so there's just a lot of people, down here.
*MOT:	I can't tell if they're in the pits or if they're, actually on the track.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um, except I would think they're in the pits because it looks like they're going the opposite direction of that car that's on the track and so they shouldn't be going in opposite directions or they'll hit each other so.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but it's not clear.
