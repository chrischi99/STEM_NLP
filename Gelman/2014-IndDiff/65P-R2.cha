*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	actually most kids cry with clowns.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they do not like clowns.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and, for what reason I don't know because I didn't like (th)em when
	I was a kid ⌈either⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	I remember crying when I first saw my first clown, and I don't know why.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	because they're really not that bad.
*MOT:	and kids do not like clowns.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and uh this one is, he's a character-ture [= caricature].
*MOT:	he l- he actually looks kinda dumpy like [?]  &=laughs.
*MOT:	he does not look very friendly.
*MOT:	but he looks like he's getting ready to, he's plugging his ears so he's looking like he's gettin(g) ready to do a gag.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	somethin(g)'s going to explode, which is not going to make too many people very happy (be)cause if it's very loud they don't, kids don't like that either too much.

	tricks and everything s- stuck in (th)em.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, probably balloons or so on and so forth.
*MOT:	ya know he's got he's got his eyes pinched closed and, ya know he's
	got the grin on and everything ⌈ but⌉.
*INV:	                               ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	um, clowns are supposed to be happy and go-lucky and and usually
	used in circuses and, for birthday parties and trying to cheer
	people up ⌈and and their goal was to make people happy⌉.
*INV:	          ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and, I think that's their ultimate goal anyway but for some reason,
	with all the getup on it just tends to scare people off more than it
	, ⌈it tends to backfire so to⌉ ⌈ speak⌉.
*INV:	  ⌊uh huh⌋.
*INV:	                               ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].

*INV:	oh.
*INV:	                                            ⌈uh huh⌉.

	out in it then I think people started to, to come around a little
	bit more but.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he's just kinda standin(g) there right now waitin(g) for
