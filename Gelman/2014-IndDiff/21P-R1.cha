*MOT:	and his peg leg and his eyepatch and his kerchief.
*MOT:	so he must not be a captain.
*MOT:	he would be a matey Firstname would say.
*MOT:	and um, Firstname would probably recognize right away that he has bullets in his belt which would mean he has a gun.
*MOT:	and Firstname prefers pirates with swords but.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and I I'm sure a shark bit his leg off.
*MOT:	I mean I could go on about pirates forever.

	about bananas and just eat it he would give me five dollars.

*MOT:	we actually have trees that grow on rocks um, in our pirate set.
*MOT:	but um, I'm not sure why she's doin(g) it from the picture.
*MOT:	but, maybe she doesn't have access to an actual tree.
