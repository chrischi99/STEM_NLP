	those things⌉.
*INV:	                                                             ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*MOT:	ah bunnies live in our yard.
*MOT:	and uh so every once in a while the kids get to see them.
*MOT:	it's fun in the spring.

*INV:	                                 ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	so we live we have an acre and a ⌊half⌋.
*INV:	                         ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and so we there's always ⌊bunnies⌋ in our yard in the spring.
*MOT:	so we haven't seen any bunnies yet.
*MOT:	but I assume we'll probably be seeing a family of bunnies pretty soon.
*INV:	&=laughs ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and the kids ⌊always⌋ think that's fun.
*MOT:	so yeah it's kinda fun to eat breakfast and look out and see bunnies in the yard.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so +...

*INV:	                                    ⌊ah⌋.
*MOT:	and that's and you know they think that's fun.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	but then I always feel ⌊like⌋ Mister_McGregor I don't want them to
	eat my garden.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	so it's yeah so it's it's uh here you always wanna have [?] oh isn't that sweet.
*MOT:	you know but it I think Peter_Rabbit is a good life story in that
	um as far as you know having conversation with kids about listening
	to grown-ups.
*INV:	      ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and I ⌊know⌋ that it's really fun to go do mischievous things but
	it's ah you know he could have really gotten in trouble.
*INV:	             ⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	and you know ⌊might⌋ not have come home.
*INV:	            ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so I mean I ⌊think⌋ that that's a good story for the kids.
*MOT:	so you know.
*MOT:	so it's kinda it's a good lesson.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes], ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	you             ⌊know⌋.

*INV:	                                           ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you ⌊know⌋ so they're always making crown hats you know.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and ⌊and⌋ uh they I like that.
*MOT:	I think it's fun that they cut out things and they're creative with what they do.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	⌊(be)cause⌋ they make crowns and belts with construction paper and
	swords sticking out the side of (th)em.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and ⌊pouches⌋ the swords can go in.
*MOT:	and they get really elaborate with their construction paper things.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	which is is fun.
*INV:	          ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so I like ⌊that⌋.
*INV:	              ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and um I like ⌊it⌋.
*MOT:	uh they get really creative about things and that's really fun.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so um, ⌈plus I think too that yeah they think about kings⌉.

*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	and and, I mean Dad of course not sure quite where +...

*MOT:	and um and the four year-old wanted to be he didn't really wanna be the prince.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	he wanted to be a knight.
*MOT:	and ⌈so it was kind of interesting⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	and then the two year-old of course is the prince.
*MOT:	and ⌈you know they go through a lot of those stories⌉, like that.
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and um sort of the whole fantasy thing.
*MOT:	which is kinda neat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	&=laughs makes me think about the Emperor's_New_Clothes (be)cause
	we just read that story ⌈fairly recently⌉.
*INV:	oh,                     ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*MOT:	⌈although he's dressed very elaborately [= king in picture]⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	the um the emperor we just read about him not being dressed very elaborate.
*MOT:	and ah yeah um so anyway.
*MOT:	but yeah that's um makes me think of there's a good story too
	that's Good_Night_Good_Knight that's sorta sweet ⌈about a knight
	with dragons and kissing his little dragons good night⌉.
*INV:	                                                 ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	⌈the dragons it was very sweet⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause the little dragons are um constantly asking for water and
	a bedtime story ⌈and all these other things⌉.
*INV:	                ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and the good knight keeps going and you know ⌈trying to say
	goodnight to them⌉.
*INV:	                                             ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	which is kinda relevant in our world.
*MOT:	so I like that story too.
*MOT:	but it's all the kings you know kings queens.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	⌈and I since I'm the only girl I like being queen⌉.
*INV:	⌊o⌋ +...
*MOT:	not to so it kinda you know.
*INV:	                                ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	it's uh I think that's the king ⌊and⌋ queen thing with us.
*MOT:	there's kind of a lot about that.
*MOT:	so anyway.
*INV:	            ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	&=flips:pages.
*MOT:	yeah that's ⌊very⌋ kings and queens and our world is full of them.
*INV:	        ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	so it's ⌊kind⌋ of fun.
*MOT:	but yeah the whole I think and the knight factor.
*MOT:	you know.
*INV:	                 ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and I think that ⌊since⌋ we have I mean I don't know if it's because
	we have boys or not.
*MOT:	but the they're always wanting to save the world you know.
*INV:	        ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	so that ⌊kind⌋ of ⌈saving the world and⌉, you know living well.
*INV:	                  ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and all those⌈good heroic royalty kind of fantasies I think⌉.
*INV:	             ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so.
*INV:	⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	⌊anyway⌋.
@G:	Weightlifter
*INV:	                 ⌈what is this⌉?
*MOT:	this is a strong ⌊man⌋.
*INV:	                  ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so ah it's uh but ⌊it's⌋ interesting (be)cause I don't know he's
	you know he knows he is.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	so um he's um yeah ah +...
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	it makes me well I think everything makes me think of my kids.
*MOT:	which probably I don't know it's probably what everybody says.
*MOT:	but it makes yeah I mean I think that's probably the point.
*MOT:	but it um our ah our kids are in gymnastics.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I think that that's really helped build their strength.
*INV:	                  ⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	and um and I like ⌊that⌋ about it because I think we always wanted
	to or we my husband and I decided we wanted to try to have them in
	something that helped build their confidence and build their skills
	and build.
*MOT:	I mean I don't really care if they were going to competition.
*MOT:	we just want them to feel good about their bodies and feel good
	about their strengths and abilities and ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	                                        ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and I think through something like gymnastics they get that confidence and coordination.
*MOT:	⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and I think boys too at a young age um they always sort of kind of
	say the coordination factor sometimes isn't ⌈quite as much there⌉.
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and I think that that's um, by giving them that confidence of body
	you know ⌈then that can help give them confidence in all areas⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so I like that about it.
*INV:	   ⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	so ⌊yeah⌋ so I definitely encourage them to be strong.
*MOT:	and ah, um +...
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	yeah I just want them to be capable.
*MOT:	you know ⌈I just want them to⌉, I, like I said it doesn't matter to
	me that they're the um top, st-you know strongest best fastest
	⌈whatever⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I just want them to feel good about who they are and where they going.
*MOT:	and um, ⌈you know  just feel good⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and ah, and be willing to try new things.
*MOT:	and be ah ⌈not afraid of their strength⌉.
*INV:	          ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	             ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you know and ⌊that⌋ kinda thing too.
*MOT:	which is funny I I think that I I um, sometimes I realized in
	there [= meaning the testing room with child] that I my first
	reaction was to go to the couch ⌈and then Firstname wanted to sit at
	the table⌉.
*INV:	                                ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and that that makes me think of that [= picture of weight lifter] in
	the sense of I have to remember (be)cause I'm always wanting them to
	be confident and strong and ⌈all those other things⌉.
*INV:	                            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and I think ⌈sometimes I need to remember togo back and sit down on
	the couch and cuddle with (th)em⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you ⌊know⌋?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	because it's so fun to observe and it's so fun to watch and it's so fun to see all their strengths and see them grow.
*MOT:	and ⌈you know part of my job is to have (th)em grow and leave⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	you know ⌈so but that makes it hard because you wanna hold (th)em
	forever⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	you know you can't do that.
*MOT:	so anyway I guess that's what it makes me think about is is growing
	up and being independent and standing on your own and you know all
	those other things.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	&=turns:page.
*MOT:	how I need to let that happen and that I can also hug (th)em ⌈and
	cuddle up with them too⌉.
*INV:	                                                             ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	   ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so ⌊anyway⌋.
@G:	Strawberry
*MOT:	which is funny that strawberries is after this (be)cause
	strawberries are kinda I don't know not cuddly but but sweet you
	know.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*INV:	⌈uh-huh [= yes] uh-huh [= filler]⌉.
*MOT:	⌊so⌋, yeah.
*MOT:	um yeah I don't know.
*MOT:	strawberries.
*MOT:	kids love (th)em.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	uh yeah.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	uh, strawberries.
*MOT:	it's very interesting.
*MOT:	I think I always look forward to June.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	you know (be)cause it's strawberry season.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	pardon me, sniffling all of a sudden.
*MOT:	the ah, yeah always looking forward to summer time and and I think
	it makes me think of dinner ⌈with the kids⌉.
*INV:	                            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	               ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and cutting up ⌊strawberries⌋ every time they're in season.
*MOT:	and um we were thinking last night about outdoors as far as taking
	the children outside and doing barbeques and doing um cookouts and
	doing all those other kinds of things.
*MOT:	and we're always trying to think of fruits and vegetables to throw
	in there and have the kids eat ⌈well you know⌉?
*INV:	                               ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	                        ⌈yeah⌉.
*MOT:	and so so it's not just ⌊hotdogs⌋.
*MOT:	but it's you know hotdogs and other things.
*MOT:	and ⌈and I think that that's one of the things that they like the
	most so it makes me think of them in that way⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	⌊strawberries⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	I don't know I guess I'd have to I'm thinking about it and I guess
	I'm kinda at a loss other than it's just one of their favorite
	fruits.
*MOT:	and I suppose one of mine.
*INV:	                    ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	oh well and I guess ⌊too⌋, this year might be one of the first years
	that I'd actually I think take them to pick strawberries.
*MOT:	seems to me I I took them to pick blueberries before  and ⌈they were
	a little young⌉.
*INV:	                                                          ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	              ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so I've kinda ⌊waited⌋ 'til they've grown up just a little bit.
*MOT:	and this year I think would be the year.
*MOT:	um I think my certainly my six year-old could have done it last year.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it's really interesting having three kids.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and as far as taking all three ⌈and um⌉, like I two year-old.
*INV:	                               ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	last year we would have had a one year-old run wondering around in the field.
*MOT:	so you either have the one year-old go with someone ⌈or you and take
	the other two or you take you know⌉.
*INV:	                                                    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	it's always a challenge to figure out how to um, have one or two kids get the experience when the other one's still really young.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] ⌈m-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so I guess what ⌊makes⌋ me think of this two and thinking of
	strawberries I guess as I go through my, brain.
*MOT:	um we used to pick them when I was a kid.
*MOT:	and we used to get up really early (be)cause we didn't wanna be out there when the sun was out there.
*MOT:	and you'd get up really early ⌈in the morning and drive out to the
	field and pick⌉ ⌈what seems like a gazillion⌉.
*INV:	                              ⌊mm-hm⌋ ⌊Mm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	⌈I mean you'd pick so many berries⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	well my mom always made jam.
*INV:	              ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	so she'd make ⌊jam⌋ and I don't know preserves and different kinds
	of things.
*MOT:	and um so and we had three kids.
*INV:	             ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and so I was ⌊the⌋ youngest.
*MOT:	so I know that too as far as you know it's a lot on the youngest.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but we would all go out there and it seemed like we would be out, I
	mean when the sun came up we were out there picking berries.
*INV:	  ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and ah it's it's funny to think about those things now with my
	⌊children⌋.
*INV:	                                                         ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and how I may or may not do some of those things with my ⌊kids⌋.
*MOT:	the other thing it makes me think of is I have a lot of I have a lot of allergies.
*MOT:	I'd do more of it I think if I didn't have so many allergies.
*INV:	              ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	the um taking ⌊ah⌋, overly ripe fruit makes my nose crazy.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and that I do remember actually doing this I forgot about that.
*MOT:	I did this a couple years ago.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and um, where we went and picked them.
*INV:	                                 ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and yeah it's it's that cleaning ⌊afterwards⌋.
*MOT:	my hands get itchy.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	my hands get itchy.
*MOT:	my face gets itchy.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	I don't know if those are things you wanna hear or not.
*MOT:	but that's what that's what I think of when I think of strawberries.
*MOT:	(be)cause I kept thinking well ⌈why don't I think more of
	strawberries⌉.
*INV:	                               ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	and ⌈that's why⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	because they have to be just ripe or it bothers my senses.
*MOT:	so ⌈anyway⌉.
*INV:	   ⌊okay⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
@G:	Lion
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	lions.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	lions.
*MOT:	lions are actually a very good kid thing.
*MOT:	you know (be)cause they're uh uh my oldest son really likes wild cats.
*MOT:	and they all ⌈I think they all like wild cats⌉.
*INV:	             ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	and [?] they all like lions.
*MOT:	certainly Lion_King has been a big factor.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	you know the um the Lion_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe is something that ah they know a little bit about.
*INV:	                                 ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	they don't know a ton about that ⌊yet⌋ but we're kind of getting
	into that with the six year-old.
*INV:	   ⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	so ⌊um⌋, I think when I see a lion I think of um, leader ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	                                                         ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	um independent.
*MOT:	courageous.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um leaders are often ah I guess it's that's since you are the leader.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I mean and a lion sometimes is alone.
*MOT:	you know like the pack is over there and the lion is you know.
*INV:	  ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	I ⌊think⌋.
*MOT:	I mean, I mean I know they kinda have their pride.
*MOT:	I don't know that they're always in the mix ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm-hm⌋ mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	they're kind of out there protecting and growing and growing the pride and grow and defending it.
*MOT:	and um but they're not always in the mix.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and so uh so yeah.
*MOT:	that's what I guess I think about which is makes me think about leadership, qualities you know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	uh, ⌈(be)cause there's that you know um when you're at the at the
	top or growing people it's you're you're not necessarily always in
	the middle of all the I mean you have friends⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊okay⌋.
*INV:	                                                      ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	but I think that it's easier to be friends with other ⌊leaders⌋ I
	think ⌈than friends with the group⌉.
*INV:	      ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I guess my job is a leadership job.
*MOT:	so ⌈I feel like I um I personally relate to this in that uh I think
	you're always trying to help the group to grow⌉.
*INV:	   ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	but you're not always in the group.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	does that make sense?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so I think you kinda always you help the group but you're not always in it.
*MOT:	but you're in it and you're welcome there.
*MOT:	but I think that you're not quite um I think there's always that
	sense of of being the the one who's really kind of the ultimate
	ultimate decision maker or ⌈ultimate you know⌉, I guess just head of
	the group.
*INV:	                           ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	you know.
*MOT:	so it's a it's an interesting place to be.
*MOT:	and it's um, you know, ⌈it's interesting anyway⌉.
*INV:	                       ⌊okay⌋.
*MOT:	and I think the Lion_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe was kinda that way too.
*MOT:	I mean as far as ah, I mean wasn't I think he the leader of the I don't know.
*INV:	hm ⌈I'm not sure⌉.
*MOT:	it's been a little ⌊while⌋.
*MOT:	I'll have to read the story again.

*MOT:	I don't know if that's a good snack anymore or not.

*MOT:	you know, the kids' world is a snack world.
*MOT:	mom when's our next snack ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	                          ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*INV:	                                   ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	almost looks not that it makes any ⌊difference⌋ but it makes me
	wonder ⌈if it's a it doesn't look like a hot pretzel I don't think⌉.
*INV:	       ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I don't know.
*INV:	oh okay.

*INV:	                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*MOT:	so my mom passed away ⌈awhile ago⌉.
*INV:	                      ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	so so yeah so it makes me feel a little mushy about that.
*MOT:	but um, and it's funny (be)cause I don't wanna feel mushy.
*MOT:	and I don't want to feel mushy in front of your camera.
*MOT:	not that it matters.
*MOT:	but actually a tissue would be great.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] absolutely.
*MOT:	thank you.
*INV:	you're welcome.

*INV:	                                   ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.

*INV:	                                ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and farm worlds and animals and ⌊vegetables⌋.
*MOT:	and I know I'll grow a um, vegetable garden this year.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	which will be fun.
*MOT:	and I think that's really good for kids to sort ofsee something
	⌈start as a seed and grow⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and that's something we always did when I was a kid.
*MOT:	and, ⌈it's really funny (be)cause the kids don't really like very
	many vegetables⌉.
*INV:	     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and I didn't think I liked very many of (th)em as a kid.
*MOT:	but it was always fun to watch them grow ⌈you know⌉?

*MOT:	so whether you ate them or not when they were done it was I
	think                                                  ⌊it⌋ I think I was more open to eating them because we grew
	them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but it wasn't my favorite by any means.
*MOT:	where now I actually like them a lot more.
*MOT:	but um you know zucchini and things which they don't really have in here.
*MOT:	but, ⌈you know it's sort of a staple in the garden I think is
	zucchini⌉.
*INV:	     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	uh it makes me think of laughs [?] I think it's funny looking at this picture.
*MOT:	I don't know if anyone else thinks this or not.
*MOT:	but, she has she has lipstick on and has a little bandana on, ⌈for
	probably no reason other than it makes her feel pretty⌉.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	and I actually respect that.
*MOT:	⌈I mean not to I think that that's um⌉, you know I think as a um as a

	⌈I think that it's important to take care of yourself⌉.
*INV:	⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*INV:	                    ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*MOT:	and that's something that I actually see with this picture ⌊too⌋.
*MOT:	is that if I were to look at her and ⌈not think of children that I
	would think of a um⌉ +...
*INV:	                                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*MOT:	but she's fit and she is um, you know a hard worker and gets
	done what she wants to get done and looks good too &*INV:mmhm you
	know.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and that's kinda funny (be)cause she was just out picking all of
	those vegetables so she probably wouldn't be as clean as she is if
	it was the real world.

*INV:	              ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	                        ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	I mean that was was the ⌊fall⌋ was decorative.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but I remember those Indian corns.
*MOT:	(be)cause I (be)cause I think as a kid you're you're face level with what's hanging on the door.

*INV:	                                          ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	   ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so ⌊um⌋.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.

*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	as far as, cooking it and eating it.

*INV:	                                                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*INV:	you know ⌈I'm not sure either⌉.
*MOT:	I don't  ⌊know⌋.
*MOT:	I don't have any idea, actually.
*MOT:	but I it's like I said it's always kind of just been decorative.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so and I think um, yeah.
*MOT:	what's really funny is I ah, I wonder if the things I don't know I find that the kids learn and come back and tell me.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you ⌊not⌋ to but at school ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	                           ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and it's sort of one of those things that gosh I never thought about that before.
*MOT:	and the teachers are so creative about things that sometimes they'll teach things.
*MOT:	and then the kids come back and um you know ⌈tell you all about it⌉.
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so makes me think that if I don't know I could probably ask my six year-old.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	because he's used to knowing more things than I do.
*MOT:	well they're always kind of I don't know telling me stuff.
*INV:	                 ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	mom did you know ⌊this⌋?
*INV:	        ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	mom did ⌊you⌋, do know that ninjas and ⌈all those other things⌉.
*INV:	                                       ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	it's true Mom I read it.

*MOT:	so you know like okay.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	okay, so good, great.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	wonderful.
*MOT:	I don't have much thought about that.
*MOT:	I don't um you know to me it looks it looks dried out.
*MOT:	because ⌈not the Indian corn but the⌉ ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I mean they always have the shucks so I would assume that obviously
	to me I guess it seems obvious that Indian corn is you know a
	different kind of breed that has a different colors in there.
*MOT:	a different kind of breed of corn ⌈I  guess⌉.
*INV:	                                  ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	um but then also I've I've only ever seen it, with dried, leaves.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so I would think that they either don't they either pick it pull it
	back and let it dry, ⌈or they um let it dry on the stalks and take
	it off⌉.
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	                  ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	I think that they ⌊would⌋ I don't know pick it first and let it dry.
*MOT:	but I don't know.
*MOT:	I don't know if I have any comment on that one way or the other.
*MOT:	just ⌈it's just corn⌉, ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	     ⌊okay⌋.
*INV:	                       ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	it's corn.
*MOT:	we like corn.
*MOT:	kids eat corn.
*MOT:	but they don't eat Indian corn.
*INV:	           ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so I don't ⌊know⌋.
*INV:	                                                  ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	yeah It'll make me later on I'll learn more about ⌊corn⌋.
@G:	Milk
*MOT:	is this milk?
*INV:	hm I'm not sure.
*MOT:	it's milk or lemonade.
*MOT:	well it's got that yellow around the ⌈side of it⌉.

*MOT:	makes me think of milk.

*MOT:	we've talked to the kids about where it comes from.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and that kinda good thing.
*MOT:	luckily none of us are intolerant ⌈of it⌉.
*INV:	                                  ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*MOT:	I just know that when we talk to the kids about it it's  uh it's just it's good for their bones you know?
*INV:	               ⌈mm-mm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	it's good good ⌊calcium⌋, rich product.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	uh, I figured out when I was a grown-up not that this is relevant to anything.
*INV:	        ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	I don't ⌊know⌋ what's I don't know what I'm supposed to talk about.
*INV:	that's alright.
*MOT:	but I figured out as a grown-up that there's different kinds of my mom must have bought different kinds of milk.
*MOT:	(be)cause as a kid I didn't like it, ⌈when it was anything over
	skim⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I didn't know that (be)cause you know your parents just buy it.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you ⌊know⌋.
*MOT:	and I didn't think about whether or not it was one percent two
	percent or skim or whole or ⌈whatever⌉.
*INV:	                            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and I have a kid who's kinda like that.
*MOT:	so, ⌈uh then I realized that he didn't really like it⌉, ⌈to drink
	when it has more fat in it⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	(be)cause it's thicker and he just didn't like it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so it's interesting to sort of look at your kid and realize that your kid kinda has those same things.
*MOT:	and you know he doesn't understand either.
*INV:	                                      ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	but it's uh it's I know it's the same ⌊thing⌋.
*MOT:	I know that it's because it's I don't really like thick high fat milk.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
