*INV:	what is this oop
	[= realized MOT had closed book again to look at title].
*MOT:	&=opens:book.
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	uh this is an elephant.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um, well I just learned that elephants what is it they, that they are pregnant for two years.
*INV:	                                            ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	and they have an incredible bond with their ⌊children⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they're extremely extremely protective of their children.
*MOT:	oh and they what was it they're I think they're more similar to humans in their bond with their children than any other animal.
*INV:	hm, oh.
*MOT:	my mother in law is writing um a children's book.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	on the two elephants that um were it was recently decided at the Detroit Zoo to send these two elephants to California.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and it really set a precedent I think internationally.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	to send animals to where their they do best.
*INV:	  ⌈uh-huh⌉ [= yes].
*MOT:	because they just were having such a hard time getting through the
	⌊winter⌋.
*MOT:	so she's taken this on as a to write children's book about it.
*INV:	oh wow.
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	um, well if you want a tip on a really good movie there's a movie called Whispers.
*INV:	⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	⌊a⌋ good kids' ⌈movie⌉.
*INV:	               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	about um, the family of it's a really wonderful movie ⌈about
	elephants⌉.
*INV:	                                                      ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and then the voices I think Whoopie Goldberg plays one of the elephants.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um about um, a family of elephants.
*MOT:	it's a really sweet movie.
*INV:	oh, okay.
*MOT:	it gives you a lot of insight into, ⌈into their lives⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so that's about it.
*INV:	alright.
@G:	Cereal
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um, oh, cornflakes.
*INV:	okay what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	I don't like cornflakes at all.
*INV:	oh, okay.
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	yeah because as soon as you put milk on (th)em I mean they're designed to be cereal.
*MOT:	but as soon as you put milk on (th)em, ⌈they get soggy⌉ ⌈and they⌉,
	they lose all their, ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	                                       ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	so I don't I don't I don't <like em> [?].
*INV:	                     ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	and plus people think that there's like it doesn't look like there's
	sugar so I think people think this is like a real healthy cereal but
	it's not a healthy ⌊cereal⌋.
*INV:	                             ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	it's probably like all white ⌊flour⌋.
*MOT:	and it just does nothing for me.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Clown
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um, this is a clown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	well, I hate to be a you know a downer but yeah I I I don't know.
*MOT:	clowns I don't know.
*MOT:	I'm just not that into clowns.
*INV:	oh, okay.
*MOT:	um &=shakes:head.
*INV:	feel free to say whatever you like.
*MOT:	I like his shoes.
*INV:	           ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= yes].
*MOT:	I guess, I guess he kinda reminds me of that character on um Jerry
	Seinfeld ⌊Kramer⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and in in the physical manifestation of just kinda being way out
	there ⌈and um⌉.
*INV:	      ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	I mean I like clowns but I I don't like.
*MOT:	I don't know it it it kinda scares me I think.
*MOT:	and even as a kid ⌈clowns kinda scared me⌉.
*INV:	                  ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	                                   ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= yes].
*MOT:	because you couldn't, couldn't see ⌊them⌋.
*MOT:	you couldn't see their real faces so.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um, but I look at the shoes and I think about the antics of Kramer
	and he just cracks me up ⌈and⌉.
*INV:	                         ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	so, I do like that.
*INV:	hm is there anything else you'd like to tell me?
*MOT:	no.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Horse
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um, it, it's a horse but it's got very long legs.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	I'm wondering if maybe it's like a Palomina or something.
*MOT:	like some type a, of race horse.
*MOT:	I don't know that much about horses but um, it's a pretty horse.
*INV:	hm, I'd like to hear more.
*INV:	what else can you say?
*MOT:	very lean like maybe a um horse horsie.
*MOT:	maybe it's just a baby horse and that's why its legs look <longer or something proportionally> [?].
*INV:	hm, can you tell me more?
*MOT:	mm, well um I'm not that I'm not that into horses horseback riding you know.
*MOT:	I like I like horses.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, my husband and I on on a trip about ten years ago we went out
	and we we uh went horseback riding um, on outside of San Francisco
	⌈near Mendocino⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋, ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= yes].
*MOT:	um, and we, we saw this ad these billboards encouraging you to go
	rent horses and go down by the ⌊beach⌋.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and it sounded really romantic.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	and so we did.
*MOT:	we went and we went down there.
*MOT:	and then all of the sudden my and I was a novice.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	my horse freaked out.
*INV:	&=gasps ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	so you would by the ⌊water⌋.
*MOT:	and so you would think that if this place was like having horses
	take tourists ⌈out to the ocean that they would be tame around
	water⌉.
*INV:	              ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	but I think that horses you know they pick up on the fear or
	something ⌈of their riders⌉.
*INV:	oh,       ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	⌈and he probably picked up⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	and you can't hide that.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	and so he started to kinda buck out of control and.
*MOT:	I just got really scared (be)cause ⌈I could not control him⌉, ⌈you
	know⌉.
*INV:	                                   ⌊sure⌋,                    ⌊sure⌋.
*MOT:	there there's a certain yeah there's a certain just alienness or um,
	unknown ⌈about animals that scares that scares⌉ ⌈me⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	hm,                                             ⌊okay⌋.
*MOT:	and then I had we were out in Colorado at a ranch, also about ten years ago.
*MOT:	and I had my dog with me.
*MOT:	and my dog who was this big ⌈ran right after this horse⌉.
*INV:	                            ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and the horse actually got scared and ran away.
*MOT:	so you know you just this that unpredictability ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	sure,                                           ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
@G:	Pilot
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um, oh well it's an airplane.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and it's a happy airplane.
*MOT:	it's like maybe uh, out of the movie The_Little_Submarine with the little Beatles soundtrack goin(g) on or something.
*MOT:	but it's not a little submarine.
*MOT:	it's a it's an airplane.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	(be)cause there's air clouds.
*MOT:	and so it looks like there's no co pilot ⌈right⌉?
*INV:	                                         ⌊hm⌋, ⌈you know what I'm not sure⌉.
*MOT:	there's the                                    ⌊pilot⌋.
*MOT:	it looks like he's looking for what happened to the co pilot doesn't it?
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	because at first I thought this was the arm of the co pilot like a little junior co pilot.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	but it's not (be)cause that's the, the control.
*INV:	hm, ⌈tell⌉ [?].
*MOT:	although I think these days they don't really control it manually
	like ⌊that⌋.
*INV:	                       ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	it's more like buttons ⌊but⌋.
*MOT:	well they <they probably> [?] still have some kinda steering wheel like that.
*INV:	hm, tell me more.
*MOT:	well he reminds me of Doctor_Pepper.
*MOT:	this reminds me of a Beatles cartoon ⌈kinda thing I think or,
	⌈animated movie⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	um so it it has a very playful, mm, satirical quality.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	um, I like his red hair.
*MOT:	that tells you that something different is probably gonna happen.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but again I think he looks, even in that simple cartoon he looks
	kinda like, kind of understated shock or understated surprise like,
	⌈oh what's happened to my co pilot⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	like we're we're in the middle of the air and he just dropped to the floor.
*MOT:	so, oh dear.
*INV:	&=laughs okay.
*MOT:	so if it's if I was doing a movie or a play ⌈I'd probably have it
	begin with this scene⌉.
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	where you're just taking taking off and then something unexpected happens that affects the whole movie.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	               ⌊so⌋.
*MOT:	but it reminds me of that Sergeant_Pepper's_Lonely that's
	it Sergeant_Pepper's_Lonely ⌈Heart_Club_Band⌉.
*INV:	                         ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	alright.
@G:	Orange
*INV:	            ⌈what is this⌉?
*MOT:	oh, mm like ⌊oranges⌋.
*INV:	              ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	um, there have been really good oranges out and I think orange
	season just ⌊ended⌋ ⌈right⌉?
*INV:	                    ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	because um the oranges I got last week and the week before were
	really bad so.
*MOT:	uh but boy when they're good they're good.
*MOT:	like April May.
*MOT:	um, I like I like oranges.
*MOT:	I love um, I love food.
*MOT:	and um, and you know it's just great to me if if if you can eat healthy foods that taste good.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I think sometimes what's hard is that you get healthy foods and they're just they just don't have much flavor.
*MOT:	or foods that are supposed to be good and.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	I don't know well you know then just sometimes they're not good.
*INV:	hm what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	well that I've learned a lot in my old age I think.
*MOT:	that there really are with fruits there are certain seasons just don't even bother.
*MOT:	like apples.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	uh I love apples but I'm not even gonna bother with apples if they're not in season.
*INV:	                    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	because you're just ⌊disappointed⌋.
*MOT:	so I think it's a good lesson about life to just enjoy, ⌈the fruit
	of the season while it's here⌉ ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	                                                        ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	                               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	um, ⌈and a lot to be said about about life⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊okay⌋.
*MOT:	about parenting.
*MOT:	about you know as a parent you you long for things you used to do or
	⌈want to do⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and I think there's just so much to be said about just enjoying the
	season, ⌈that's right here and ripe right now⌉, so.
*INV:	        ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Popcorn
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	oh, popcorn.
*MOT:	popcorn.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	okay that's what Firstname wanted for breakfast this morning.
*MOT:	um, we've been having that have having that as a little snack.
*MOT:	and um that's a it's a healthy snack.
*MOT:	and I'm trying to lose weight right now.
*MOT:	and so, um I'm always trying to have that lite that no fat ⌈popcorn
	around⌉.
*INV:	                                                           ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause um I love popcorn too (be)cause it's it's uh, it doesn't it's not too greasy so it doesn't make you feel bad.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, and it's it's healthy.
*MOT:	and it it's just I like something that's crunchy and salty so.
*INV:	hm what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	oh I can tell you that when I was in my when I about twenty years ago when I was on this diet all I ate was all I ate was that popcorn carrots and coffee.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	yeah you wouldn't have wanted to be around me but, I was thinner.
*MOT:	um &=laughs, you now I did lose weight ⌈but um⌉.
*INV:	                                       ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	uh so much nice about popcorn and corn and.
*MOT:	like when I lived in Kenya it was there was corn was such a staple.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I don't think we actually had popcorn but people would make things that were similar.
*INV:	  ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	you know like roasted mahindi and I think I talked about that last
	⌊time⌋.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	but um well I can't go to a movie without having popcorn.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I just can't.
*MOT:	it's just not the same.
*MOT:	so I like popcorn.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	it's the kinda thing that you can indulge in and it's very sensual,
	⌈but you don't have to feel guilty about⌉.
*INV:	⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
@G:	Lobster
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	you're not five years old are you?
*INV:	&=laughs no.
*MOT:	no okay, good &=laughs.
*MOT:	um, oh, it's a lobster right?
*INV:	mm ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you don't ⌊okay [?]⌋.
*INV:	feel free to say whatever ⌈you'd like⌉.
*MOT:	I I I I always I confuse lobsters and crabs a little ⌊bit⌋.
*MOT:	but I think ⌈that this is a lobster because when you order a l whole
	lobster⌉ ⌈and you think you're gonna be getting a lot⌉, ⌈you're
	really not getting that much⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	                            ⌈uh-huh [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	because this this is pretty ⌊small⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um, but I love lobster.
*MOT:	that's one of the best foods.
*MOT:	and the best lobster that I ever had was when I was with my husband.
*MOT:	it it was before kids.
*MOT:	shortly before kids.
*MOT:	and we went up we took a, drive we went to a wedding outside of
	Boston ⌈and then took a drive up to Maine in July⌉.
*INV:	       ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	                                                      ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and um oh it was really cheap lobster at this seaside ⌊shack⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	on the um pier and the water.
*MOT:	it was just &=sighs it was so nice.
*INV:	mm go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	um well my husband my husband's element is the water and fishing and stuff.
*INV:	               ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so any kind of seafood like crab or lobster or or or fish salmon
	that kind of ⌊thing⌋.
*MOT:	I I but you know we both we both enjoy that a lot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so my husband is um going to Alaska.
*MOT:	he has a cabin ⌈there with some friends that he's built over the
	past fifteen years⌉.
*INV:	               ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, he's going there to uh, participate in salmon uh I think it's trolling long line.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	he's got friends that are commercial fishermen up there so he's going up [?] there in August.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	so I just think of I think of the sea when I see lobster and I think
	of how much I wanted to live, ⌈near the ocean⌉.
*INV:	                              ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	either the east coast or the west coast.
*MOT:	this makes me think of the northeast and how much I love that part of the world.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], okay.
*MOT:	but that Ann Arbor's nice.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes] &=laughs.
@G:	Teacher
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	oh boy.
*MOT:	um this is a math teacher.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	⌊geometry⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	probably middle school.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, well I I was a math teacher in Peace_Corps so I ⌈I'm thinking
	she's probably a Peace_Corps teacher here⌉.
*INV:	                                                    ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	little formal.
*MOT:	she I she wouldn't probably be wearing those heels but she might be wearing a skirt and that other, look.
*MOT:	I always I love math I loved math.
*MOT:	and I um wish I'd been encouraged in math.
*INV:	                              ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	because I I actually what was ⌊it⌋?
*MOT:	I think I was supposed to teach something else but then in
	Peace_Corps I tested really well in math ⌈and so they had me teach
	math instead⌉.
*INV:	                                         ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	um, I love math.
*MOT:	I love the comfort of math.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and having an answer.
*MOT:	you know in classes like psychology ⌈and English and comparative lit
	and⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	you know there's no right ⌈there's there's theories and there's
	assumptions and there's uh⌉, there's maybe there's not an answer ⌈
	right⌉?
*INV:	                          ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	                                                                 ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	but in math you always get an answer and I always liked that.
*MOT:	um, geometry was a little hard for me but I am uh, a concrete thinker like that.
*MOT:	where I like the angles and the designs and.
*MOT:	and I married an engineer ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], what more can you tell ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	uh, uh, well I honestly can't tell you what all those angles mean at this point.
*MOT:	I I guess there's, an obtuse and an acute and, ⌈it's kinda slipped
	away now⌉.
*INV:	                                               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	I can't really tell you about [?] all that.
*MOT:	but when my kids grow up I'll be relearning it all ⌈again so⌉.
*INV:	                                                   ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and I'm actually looking forward to that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] yeah.
*MOT:	well you know you don't pay as much attention the first time around.
*MOT:	and then, then when you get to be about my age you start realizing that there's an application for a lot of these things and.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, I I like, I like this picture.
*MOT:	I'm comfortable here.
*INV:	oh okay.
*MOT:	this is a place I'm comfortable.
*MOT:	I love, ⌈I love school⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	I love um, I love sitting in a classroom.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	I love sitting in a classroom and listening and absorbing.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	um this is a lot on my mind right now because um we just made the decision to send Firstname to kindergarten.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and he he is a he'll be young.
*MOT:	he'll be you need to be five years old by December first to enter kindergarten and he'll be five September first.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and so it's a situation where he doesn't have to go.
*INV:	uh-⌈huh [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	he can ⌊go⌋.
*MOT:	and so we really thought about whether to delay him or not.
*MOT:	so we decided that we're going to send him because we don't have, enough reasons even though he is young.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	we don't really have enough reasons to not.
*MOT:	he's he's so um, absorbed in learning right now ⌈that it seems like
	it would be the right place⌉.
*INV:	                                                ⌊sure⌋.
*MOT:	but we do have a choice in schools.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and so we applied to the xxx open ⌈lottery system⌉.
*INV:	                                  ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	if you're familiar with that, John Dewey, ⌈style⌉.
*INV:	                                          ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and so that's more of an open thematic learning style.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I'm somebody who's more comfortable in this kinda lecture, concrete at least this is how I associate it.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	um, little bit more of the [?] traditional, ⌈this is what you're
	learning now⌉.
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	sure.
*MOT:	and, I don't know you know so I right now this is so this is what I expect with school.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and then um I'm waiting to see how that is gonna compare how that
	new environment is going to compare to a traditional ⌈school⌉.
*INV:	                                                     ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause it's really intriguing to me to think about how they like how that school would teach, these formulas and these rules, in an open environment.
*MOT:	because in that the way the theory goes is that you you create an
	environment ⌈that inspires and invites the child to learn⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	so I'm just not quite sure how you how like I'm picturing myself if I was a kid in middle school or elementary, how a teacher would set up an environment to, to learn that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	without putting that on the board and having ⌈the kids I don't know
	so⌉.
*INV:	                                             ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	there's a lot of anxiety about what my expectations are ⌈about⌉, how
	he's gonna be learning.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊sure⌋.
