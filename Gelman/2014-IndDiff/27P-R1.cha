@Types:	cross, narrative, TD
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	okay this is a uh, a frog.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	uh I think this frog is getting ready to act.
*MOT:	this frog is, ⌈um⌉, thinking about its next move and deciding.
*INV:	              ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	it looks like by its posture that he looks pretty rigid.
*INV:	&=nods:yes.
*MOT:	and it looks like he is really trying to size up his environment and see if he's being threatened.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	to decide where he's gonna go next.
*INV:	hm okay.
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	mm, well I think that what happens.
*MOT:	he looks like a very confident frog.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I think that he's probably going to make the right move.
*MOT:	I think he's gonna jump.
*MOT:	and, probably maybe onto a lily pad or something.
*INV:	                       ⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	and I think that he is going to succeed in getting away from
	whatever's bothering ⌊him⌋.
*INV:	okay, great.
*MOT:	he looks very confident.
*INV:	hm.
@G:	Farmer
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	oh this is very nice.
*MOT:	this um, this harkens back to the olden days.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, this is a time I would have liked to have lived.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	where everything was very simple.
*MOT:	the lines of this photo are.
*MOT:	you know everything's very simple.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it's probably it looks to me like it might be well it's either on a farm now or maybe in the eighteen nineties.
*MOT:	um where this woman is obviously tending to her farm and carrying
	in, pumpkins and vegetables and carrots and things for dinner that
	⌈she's gonna make⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and um they know that these things are good and and healthy because they grew them themselves.
*MOT:	and, ⌈um⌉, her husband is probably not far away.
*INV:	     ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	he's probably working the fields.
*MOT:	and the kids are uh, I don't know where kids went in those days.
*INV:	⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	⌊preschool⌋?
*MOT:	maybe they're at preschool.
*INV:	you know I'm not sure either.
*INV:	I'd like to hear more.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	mm, she looks very strong.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um she looks very healthy.
*MOT:	and that's, that's what it's about I think.
*MOT:	living a you know, ⌈a healthy simple lifestyle is very appealing to
	me right now and something that⌉, gets my interest.
*INV:	                   ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and uh oh lookit those look like there's a barn in the back there.
*INV:	                                           ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	it looks a little bit nice to keep animals ⌊in⌋.
*MOT:	I I can't quite tell, ⌈what that's used for⌉.
*INV:	                      ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	maybe corn or vegetables or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], okay anything else you wanna tell me?
*MOT:	nope.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Rabbit
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	well that's a bunny rabbit.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	<you know> [?] I'm not very good with animals.
*MOT:	but I have learned a lot about animals from my children.
*INV:	                                               ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	so I I I guess I would say, that it's a, bunny ⌊rabbit⌋.
*MOT:	but because of the ears.
*MOT:	but, the face doesn't look like a bunny rabbit ⌈to me⌉.
*INV:	                                               ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	what do you think?
*INV:	you know I'm not sure.
*MOT:	I think it is a bunny rabbit though.
*MOT:	I think it's kind of a chubby one.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it's a little chubbier than the one in Winnie_the_Pooh ⌈so it's a
	little hard to tell⌉.
*INV:	oh                                                     ⌊yes⌋.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes], what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	it looks a little scared.
*MOT:	it looks timid.
*MOT:	it looks like it just wants to be sure that nobody's gonna hurt it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	not really.
*INV:	okay, that's alright.
*MOT:	looks like this one ear might be up, like perked up, ⌈trying to
	listen⌉, ⌈to something⌉.
*INV:	                                                     ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Weightlifter
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	well that's Firstname's ideal.
*MOT:	um, that is a super hero.
*MOT:	that guy is um, very strong and happy with himself.
*MOT:	and, um I think he's a little overdeveloped in the ⌈upper physique
	myself⌉ ⌈but⌉, um.
*INV:	                                                   ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	        ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little more.
*MOT:	I like this picture.
*MOT:	it's it's funny.
*MOT:	it makes me kinda laugh (be)cause it's.
*MOT:	the way they've drawn it the guy's kinda poking fun at himelf.
*MOT:	he he realizes how, silly he's being and how self satisfied he is.
*MOT:	when I usually look if I look at a guy like that I kinda think, they're a little bit too much into themselves, um.
*INV:	okay anything else you wanna say?
*MOT:	well this kinda character's really gotten my interest now that I
	have two boys because a it's unbelievable how um.
*MOT:	I'm from a family of girls.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and how boys are just so, so influenced by wanting to look like this
	and ⌈be like this⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	because this guy can really probably do anything.
*MOT:	save you know, ⌈save⌉, hundreds of people from a, burning building or
	you know.
*INV:	               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so this whole power this whole power um stance is very, interesting to me right now.
*INV:	hm, ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	    ⌊it's⌋ a little difficult (be)cause it sets up in kids uh,
	expectation that they can ⌈do these things and that they⌉, they
	can't.
*INV:	                          ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	nobody can.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but it's a nice image to have that invincibility so.
*INV:	mm okay.
@G:	Strawberry
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that looks good.
*MOT:	that looks like um, a strawberry.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].

*INV:	                                               ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	because I love strawberries and mint.
*MOT:	and so the mint then makes me think of a um, mojito drink.
*MOT:	a Cuban mojito.
*INV:	            ⌈uh-huh [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	that's very ⌊good⌋.
*MOT:	and that it's springtime and summertime.
*MOT:	and pretty soon we'll be out having strawberries and that kinda thing so.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	&=sighs well ya know so looking at this I've realized I've never
	gone strawberry picking.
*MOT:	so I've I really, I've never seen a strawberry like.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	in its leaf ⌈like that⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and that maybe I should go strawberry picking.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Surfer
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that looks like my husband.
*MOT:	and, it looks like um a lot of fun.

	go to⌉.
*INV:	                               ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	           ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and um, so I've been thinking about how much fun that's gonna be
	with the ⌊kids⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	I'd like to hear more.
*INV:	what else can you say?
*MOT:	about this photo?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	well I like this guy.
*MOT:	he looks like he's not you know like a super power guy but he I like him.
*MOT:	he he's shows a really good spirit that he's he's not it doesn't look like he's like a real young like he's not a teenager.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but he still has the um love of life to go try to surf.
*MOT:	that's pretty good.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	yeah he's kinda like your your I like this a lot (be)cause he's
	kinda like your everyday average guy, ⌈who's willing to take life to

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and um we had a lot of corn.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	we had cornmeal porridge for breakfast.

*INV:	                     ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you'd cut it up like ⌊bread⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so you had a you had a lot of corn.

*INV:	                                         ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	(be)cause mahindi's the word for corn in ⌊Swahili⌋.
*MOT:	and uh, that's what I think of.
*INV:	wow, go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	well and then of course here in the U S eh, corn is such a nice
	symbol for the harvest and the fall and, ⌈um all that we have to be
	grateful for⌉.
*INV:	                                         ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	what did she say they have no sense of smell.
*INV:	hm.

*INV:	oh &=laughs.
*MOT:	did you know that?
*INV:	oh, no &=laughs.
*MOT:	owls have no sense of smell.
*MOT:	and so it doesn't matter to them what they're eating what it smells like.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	I remember that.
*INV:	wow.
*INV:	          ⌈tell me more⌉.

*MOT:	and uh, including his little girl.
*INV:	&=gasps.
