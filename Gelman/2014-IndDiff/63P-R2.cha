*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	a surfer.
*MOT:	a happy surfer.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I think of California.
*MOT:	the beach.
*MOT:	I think of a girl the young girls that got attacked by sharks when they were surfing recently.
*MOT:	well in the last year or so.
*MOT:	and uh numerous reports in the news about people being attacked by sharks.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um well, this kind of doesn't look extremely realistic.
*MOT:	the wave doesn't look really big and um.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	um he has a cross on his chest.
*MOT:	I don't know if that means anything.
*INV:	uh huh.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Pretzel
*INV:	and then [?] what is this?
*MOT:	a pretzel.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	with big salt crystals on the outside.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um well first thing that comes to mind is the pretzel stores in the mall.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, these are like the the bready pretzels.
*MOT:	not the kind that you buy in the potato chip aisle.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	hard ones.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um it would taste salty.
*MOT:	my husband likes to make pretzels at home, sometimes.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um sometimes on a holiday like New Year's Eve or something.
*MOT:	he knows how to make (th)em at home ⌈and I've helped him once, or
	twice⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	um, yeah.
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	I think pretzels make a nice snack.
*MOT:	they're not um well I'm not sure about this kind but the other kind of pretzel the hard ones they don't have any fat in them.
*MOT:	so it's kind of a healthy snack.
*MOT:	it doesn't have sugar.
*MOT:	I mean if you're trying to avoid sugar it would be a healthy snack.
*MOT:	if you're trying to avoid salt you might want to wipe some of that salt off.
*INV:	mm-hm, anything else?
*MOT:	well the the place at the mall called xxx [= store name] I've had
	some gift certificates from there ⌈before⌉.
*INV:	                                  ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	so that made a nice little snack though they're pretty expensive.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I think they charge too much.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	for like I don't know two or three dollars for a pretzel.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	seems a bit high to me ⌈but that's all⌉.
*INV:	                       ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Strawberry
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like a very nice strawberry.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, makes me think of summer.
*MOT:	um makes me think of one time when I went strawberry picking at xxx [=  orchard name].
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and the strawberries were not nearly that nice.
*MOT:	(be)cause it was really a dry summer and the strawberries just were not really good at all.
*MOT:	so that was kind of a disappointment.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um this one looks nice and red with very dark green leaves and.
*INV:	mm-hm, tell me more.
*MOT:	we tried to grow strawberries at our house.
*MOT:	and they wouldn't grow in our garden ⌈because apparently we had the
	year before we had planted vine plants⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um some kind like squash or zucchini, cucumbers.
*MOT:	and apparently they I think this was the reason they didn't do well at all.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	because they were in the same place as ⌈where those had been⌉.
*INV:	                                       ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so that was disappointing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	(be)cause I love strawberries.
*MOT:	they're like one of my favorite fruits.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and uh one summer I was in Norway and they had really awesome strawberries over there.
*MOT:	so they were better than the ones that I was used to here.
*INV:	                                 ⌈anything el⌉ +...
*MOT:	I got to help I got to help pick ⌊them⌋.
*INV:	             ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	I like doing ⌊that⌋.
*MOT:	it's fun.
*INV:	uh huh, anything else?
*MOT:	um I guess not.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Farmer
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like a picture a cartoon picture of a woman who is, um like harvest harvesting her garden.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	looks like I would say it's fall.
*MOT:	there's pumpkins and maybe apples.
*MOT:	maybe I don't know long green, stem like I don't know like rhubarb or celery or something.
*MOT:	I can't really tell, ⌈what that is⌉.
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	um, looks like she lives in the country.
*MOT:	she's got a big bushel basket like we get when we go apple picking at xxx [= orchard name].
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that holds a lot.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	oh she's wearing a big hat like with a brim so ⌈maybe to protect her
	from the sun⌉.
*INV:	                                               ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	to provide shade for her face.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she's wearing a little handkerchief around her neck which I don't know maybe for if she gets sweaty or something.
*MOT:	so maybe it's a hot day.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	um she's wearing like overalls and casual clothes.
*MOT:	short sleeves.
*MOT:	so that would give more reason to think that it might be a warm day.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	mm guess not.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Police Officer
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	uh looks like a policewoman.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she's talking on a CB radio or something, I would say.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um standing next to her car, with [?] the door open.
*MOT:	she's got a badge.
*MOT:	and like a badge on her hat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and more badges on her sleeve which probably means something but I'm not exactly sure what.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it looks official.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um probably maybe some awards or her status or rank in the police force I would guess.
*MOT:	she's got some keys on her belt.
*MOT:	and oh there's like a looks like there's a ch- a fence or bars between the front seat and the back seat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, ⌈I would sa- [?]⌉ +...
*INV:	what else can you tell ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	I would say that  would like if she picks up someone that's
	dangerous ⌈um that would be for her protection⌉, I would guess.
*INV:	          ⌊mm-hm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	or if they're transporting someone that's in jail or needs to be locked up for some reason.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's what I think about that.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	it looks kind of old fashioned because this doesn't look like high tech you know this radio thing here.
*MOT:	so I would say it's from +...
*MOT:	and the car also looks a little bit like maybe seventies or
	something ⌈I don't know⌉.
*INV:	uh        ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	just a guess.
*MOT:	seventies eighties.
*INV:	uh huh, uh huh.
*MOT:	something like that.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Corn
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like a ear of corn.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	a fall a fall um, decoration.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	can be a used as a decoration.
*MOT:	uh we call it Indian corn.
*MOT:	um and I don't know looks like kind of dried out on the ears.
*INV:	   ⌈tell me more⌉.
*MOT:	we ⌊don't⌋ we don't usually eat this kind.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but we use it as a decoration.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and this ones got interesting colors, but different than other corn I have seen before.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, yeah I would think it makes me think of fall and harvest time.
*MOT:	maybe a Halloween party or something.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	I guess it makes me think of like the stories we hear about the first Thanksgiving.
*MOT:	and the Indians bringing teaching the pilgrims how to use corn to plant or no how to plant corn.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, yeah it reminds me of that kind of story.
*INV:	mm-hm, okay good.
@G:	Pie
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	uh this looks like a apple pie.
*MOT:	looks homemade.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, it looks like a lot of work like more work than I would do to make a pie.
*MOT:	like because the crust is like these little strips and that would
	take um +...
*MOT:	usually when I've made pies I haven't put anything on the top.
*INV:	mm-hm mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so to me that looks very fancy.
*MOT:	and but it looks yummy and.
*INV:	mm-hm, tell me more.
*MOT:	um, actually it looks a little dry.
*MOT:	I guess right now I'm not very hungry so.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	the apple part I would like, would appeal to me more.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um yeah I guess we usually have apple pies around fall.
*MOT:	at um my daughter's school they have a fundraiser for where they
	make the parents make apple pies ⌈and then sell them⌉.
*INV:	                                 ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	and but that kind has a different topping.
*MOT:	it has it's supposed to be a Dutch apple pie and ⌈it has more of a
	strudel⌉.
*INV:	                                                 ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	like a brown sugar ⌈butter type topping⌉.
*INV:	oh,                ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and that's pretty good.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	most a lot people don't make there's not a lot of homemade pies at least.
*MOT:	I mean mostly a lot of times you know it's more convenient to buy
	one at the store ⌈or go to a restaurant where someone else is making
	it⌉.
*INV:	                 ⌊mm-hm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but um my husband's grandmother she still makes, well up (un)til last year she made a lot of homemade pies.
*MOT:	and she would probably make one like this.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Lion
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	oh this looks like a very well pretty ferocious lion.
*MOT:	his mane is all sticking up and looks a little un-like more sticking up than a lot of lions.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	like what I'm used to seeing.
*MOT:	not that I see many lions but.
*MOT:	um it makes me think of the new movie that's coming out.
*MOT:	the Narnia movies that are coming out Friday.
*MOT:	this Friday.
*MOT:	and we're looking forward to seeing that.
*INV:	uh huh, tell me more.
*MOT:	uh well the lion in that move is called Asland and he's a pretty cool character.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um I think they say, what about him what do they say?
*MOT:	he's not tame, he's not wild +...
*MOT:	I can't remember exactly.
*MOT:	yeah he's not a tame lion.
*MOT:	he like wont hurt you or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	anyway um, so the lion is called the king of beasts.
*MOT:	or the king of the jungle or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	this is a male lion, I believe.
*MOT:	they're the ones that have the big manes.
*MOT:	I think they live in Africa.
*MOT:	you can go on safaris and see them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, I would not want to be real close to one, in real life.
*MOT:	I'd be scared.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	I guess that's it.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Milk
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like a glass of milk I would say.
*MOT:	it's pretty full.
*MOT:	it's a full glass.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so we don't have to have the debate of whether the glass is half
	full or half empty (be)cause this is pretty clear obviously a glass
	half-uh that's full.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	which if someone sees the glass as being half full that means
	they're pos positive they're optimistic rather than being
	pessimistic.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um if you see a glass as half full and you think of it as being half empty you're seeing things negatively.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um just +...
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	um well there are many different kinds of milk that you can buy in the store.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	such as whole milk.
*MOT:	skim milk.
*MOT:	two percent.
*MOT:	half percent.
*MOT:	⌈one percent⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	and chocolate milk.
*MOT:	and probably buttermilk.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um you can buy them by the half gallon.
*MOT:	or the gallon.
*MOT:	um well sometimes, I was at the grocery store last night and I bought milk.
*MOT:	and it was two nineteen for a gallon.
*MOT:	and it said limit two.
*MOT:	and that was kind of surprising (be)cause I hadn't run into that at this store.
*MOT:	that's usually if the price, that was like the normal price.
*MOT:	and so they usually didn't have a limit on it so I usually got three.
*MOT:	but I was like well gosh I wonder if I bought a third one what it was gonna cost.
*MOT:	is it gonna be like +...
*MOT:	well the other time they had a higher price than two nineteen it was
	like two forty nine and so I was like eh, I guess I'll just buy two
	because I don't want to pay two forty nine.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	maybe I'll come back later in the week or something when we run out.
*MOT:	so now it's making me wonder like oh they're starting to limit +...
*MOT:	this used to be the regular price of milk.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	that was like one of the main reasons we were going to this grocery store.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	like for my husband at least that was a big factor.
*MOT:	he liked the price of their milk was lower than a lot of other stores.
*MOT:	and uh, so I'm this is getting me worried like oh they're starting to limit it.
*MOT:	does that mean they're gonna raise the price of milk like ⌈after
	we're all used to going to the store you know⌉?
*INV:	                                                          ⌊mm-hm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and then it's going to be two forty nine all the time.
*MOT:	so we'll see we'll just have to see.
*INV:	okay good good.
*MOT:	that's my story about milk.
@G:	King
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like a king.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	from a long time ago.
*MOT:	I would say from like a story book or.
*MOT:	um he's wearing a crown.
*MOT:	he's jolly and plump.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he's uh got a big smile.
*MOT:	he's got a pipe.
*MOT:	he's got some kind of a crest behind him on this you can only see part of it.
*MOT:	but it has like I think it represents his family or something.
*MOT:	they do that in England and Scotland and maybe other places too.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	well it reminds me of like Henry the eighth and I don't know much about him.
*MOT:	but he had I think he had eight wives and killed some of them.
*MOT:	(be)cause he they were not pleasing to him.
*MOT:	he's got on like a real fancy, robe.
*MOT:	and it looks like some kind of a Dalmatian fur or something though I don't know what it is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he's got some kind of big necklace on with maybe jewels or um.
*MOT:	it looks kind of like the middle ages or the seventeen hundreds or
	something, ⌈to me⌉.
*INV:	           ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	looks like there's an artist signature down on the bottom so maybe it was drawn by someone and that's the name of the artist.
*MOT:	firstname or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	can't really read it.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	well you don't see people these days dressing like this except maybe at the Renaissance festival.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, I've been to that once.
*MOT:	or maybe if people are dressing up for um, what do they call that?
*MOT:	not impersonations but I forget.
*MOT:	like where you see them, reinactors.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	reinactors of the past.
*MOT:	yeah you see that sometimes at the xxx [= city name] Heritage
	Festival or ⌈other places⌉ ⌈I suppose⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	                           ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Frog
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like a frog.
*MOT:	or maybe it's a toad.
*MOT:	I'm not really sure how to tell the difference.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, their eyes its eyes are sticking up.
*MOT:	it looks kind of bumpy.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	uh it's a adult I guess.
*MOT:	because like it would have started out as an egg.
*MOT:	and then a tadpole.
*MOT:	and then it grows legs and.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	I think there's fairy tales about frogs and um, kissing them and they turn into a handsome prince or something like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they are known they can hop.
*MOT:	that's how they get around.
*MOT:	they've got long tongues.
*MOT:	they catch flies.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I think they just &=makes:shooting_noise shoot out their tongue and
	catch whatever insect that's flying by.
*MOT:	um they live in water.
*MOT:	ponds.
*MOT:	they make um especially around like springtime I think you hear you
	can hear them if you're near a pond they make a lot of noise.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	a lot of croaking and.
*MOT:	it's kind of cool to hear one of those nature nice nature sounds.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	good good.
@G:	Snake
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like some kind of a dangerous snake.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	like a cobra or something.
*MOT:	um it's got some kind of markings on the back which I am not familiar with.
*MOT:	but probably means something.
*MOT:	and someone who knows about snakes would be able to identify which
	type it is ⌈based on the colorings and the markings⌉ ⌈other features
	of the snake⌉.
*INV:	           ⌊mm-hm⌋,                                  ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	it's got a lot of lines on it.
*MOT:	which is an interesting pattern.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	um, it's kind of facing away from the picture from me.
*MOT:	um yeah I would say like this makes me think of a poisonous snake.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um my dad I think when he was in the Vietnam war they like came
	across some cobras came into their tent or into their camp site
	where they were and they had to kill them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he has a picture of him or someone else holding like a really long snake.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	but I think that was different colors than this.
*MOT:	it was I don't know maybe had some yellow in it and stuff.
*INV:	mm-hm, anything more?
*MOT:	I would not want to meet this snake.
*MOT:	on a path somewhere.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and what would be the best thing to do if you did?
*MOT:	back away slowly perhaps.
*MOT:	and then (be)cause I think they could probably spring ⌈and bite you⌉.
*INV:	uh                                                    ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and you wouldn't want that to happen.
*MOT:	I don't see a little rattler rattle on the tail so.
*MOT:	I would say it's not a rattle snake.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but I guess that's it.
*INV:	okay good great.
@G:	Weightlifter
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this is a cartoon picture of a man.
*MOT:	a very strong man apparently.
*MOT:	um lifting these big weights.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um I've seen like in the Olympics there's a weight lifting part.
*MOT:	I think the winter Olympics.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and there's these really big [?] guys and probably like women too with really strong muscles.
*MOT:	and they have to lift them over their head.
*MOT:	and they're all straining and &=demonstrates.
*MOT:	and then all of a sudden they get it and they're like &=makes:noise.
*MOT:	and they have to hold it for a certain amount of time ⌈before they
	drop it and practically collapse⌉.
*INV:	uh                                                    ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	um, ⌈let's see⌉.
*INV:	what more can you tell ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	well I guess this guy is like a bodybuilder.
*MOT:	bodybuilders try to get really strong on the top.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he's a lot bigger on the top than on his waist and legs.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, which kind of gives the idea of super strength powerful,
	⌈physical power anyway⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he looks proud of himself I guess.
*MOT:	sometimes um these things like it could be looking like he's really
	strong but sometimes there's like these weights could actually just
	not weigh anything.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and then they just like pretend.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	you might see this kind of guy character at a circus or something maybe.
