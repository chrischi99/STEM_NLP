*MOT:	mm looks like it might be a couple weeks old (be)cause it's got its eyes open and it's walkin(g) around.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] go ahead and ⌈say a little bit more⌉.
*MOT:	mm, I just saw a show on tv where there was a, they were, it was
	like pet police or       ⌊something⌋.
*MOT:	and they were arresting a guy because he killed a dog because it growled at his son.
*INV:	                                                   ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	and then threw it off the top of like a four story ⌊building⌋.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	so um they'd they had a puppy at his house still and so they confiscated the puppy and took him to jail.
*INV:	oh my.
*MOT:	                                          ⌈so, <it's kinda> [?], sad⌉.

*MOT:	and I still every once in awhile get the craving for white bread
	because, ⌈it has no real taste to it⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊sure⌋.
*MOT:	⌈so⌉ it doesn't take away from the food as much, ⌈as wheat bread⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋                                  ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	but I try to eat wheat bread because it's better for you.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], tell me more.
*MOT:	um, mm, we eat honey, whole grain, ⌈wheat bread now⌉.
*INV:	                                   ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and I don't like it (be)cause when it goes in the toaster it doesn't
	toast the same as white bread.
*INV:	oh uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	(be)cause white bread gets really crispy, ⌈and stays crispy⌉.
*INV:	                                          ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	with wheat bread the outside gets a little crispy.
*MOT:	but then after about thirty seconds it gets soft again.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	which is a little frustrating ⌈(be)cause when you want toast you
	want it to be⌉, crisp.
*INV:	                              ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	but, I try to get used to ⌈it⌉.
*INV:	                          ⌊sure⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause it is good.
*INV:	          ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	it's just ⌊different⌋.
*MOT:	and I have to get used to the difference.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	and that's all for [?] the bread.
@G:	Baby

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	she's laying.

*INV:	       ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	(be)cause female ducks usually are just straight brown so they can
	hide ⌊better⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um, it's interesting because in our society you know humans, ⌈it's
	the women that are all you know dressed up or whatever⌉ ⌈to attract
	the men⌉.
*INV:	                                                             ⌊right⌋.

*MOT:	and the men are pretty plain most of the time.
*MOT:	but in almost every other, creature, you know the men are the ones
	that are all dressed up ⌈fancy⌉.
*INV:	                        ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	and you know they go around trying to attract the females, you know.

*MOT:	⌈like [?] they're all colorful⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	⌈yeah⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.

*INV:	          ⌊su⌋.
*MOT:	the females don't because they want to keep the babies alive, ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	but I think it's interesting.

*MOT:	we have some ducks staying in the pond at Eastern.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so they so that's pretty cool.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	my daughter loves to watch them.
*MOT:	um we went to the zoo we saw some baby ducks in the hippo pond.
*MOT:	they were very cute.
*MOT:	they'd swim right over to us.
*MOT:	I think it's (be)cause everybody feeds them.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	even though they're not supposed to.
*MOT:	and there were signs up saying don't put money in the pools because
	the ducks and the fish ⌈eat it⌉.
*INV:	                       ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	and people still throw money in the pools.
*MOT:	I don't know what they think.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	you know, it's not like it's a wishing well or anything.
*INV:	              ⌈right⌉.
*MOT:	so they just toss money in like they think it's funny that the
	animals eat ⌊it⌋.

*INV:	                                   ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.

*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	she'd only eat like hotdogs.
*MOT:	and that was it.
*MOT:	couldn't get her to eat like anything.
*MOT:	so I'd sneak it into foods.

*MOT:	and so she I'd be like do you like your special jello?
*MOT:	and she'd say yes I like my special jello, but I don't like those
	things in it.
*MOT:	so she caught on after a while.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but um, I still do that every once in awhile (be)cause you know.
*MOT:	I'd put it in blue jello and it would dye (th)em all blue so there would be blue carrots in it.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	you gotta be creative.
*INV:	uh-⌈huh⌉ [= yes].
*MOT:	um, sometimes if she's hungry I'll give her carrots and peanut
	 ⌊butter⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and most of the time she'll just lick the peanut butter off the carrot.
*MOT:	⌈but sometimes she'll eat it⌉.
*INV:	⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	every little bit counts, you know?
*INV:	sure.
*MOT:	carrots are one of the least healthy vegetables for you because
	they're mostly sugar, ⌈and water⌉.
*INV:	hm.
*INV:	                      ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	so, I didn't know that when I was younger.
*MOT:	but it's true.
*MOT:	um, that's why they're so good.
*MOT:	because they taste like sugar.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	uh, put carrots in a lot of things.
*MOT:	when we cook chicken and rice we put a lot of carrots in.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	⌈we mostly buy the little baby carrots⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	um because we like to eat (th)em by themselves too.
*MOT:	and they're easy and convenient.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they're pre skinned so you don't have to worry about, you know cleaning off the carrots.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	mm.

*MOT:	that's it.
@G:	Banana

*MOT:	so like I bought a pineapple and we just cut that yesterday.
*MOT:	and my daughter painted on it afterwards.
*MOT:	she made Spongebob's house.

*MOT:	and we took pictures and I then I threw it away.
*INV:	                             ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	um, and we bought apples.
*MOT:	and we've been trying to like use those as snacks instead of, ⌈you
	know chips and stuff because⌉, we like that.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um, for some reason I enjoy bananas best when I cut them up first and then eat them out of a bowl.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	it's like when they oxidize a little bit, ⌈they taste sweeter to me⌉,
	⌈for some reason⌉.
*INV:	                                          ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	it's like the texture's a little bit different.
*MOT:	it's not as rough.
*MOT:	you know like it'd it sounds gross.
*MOT:	it gets a little like slimier.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so it has a softer texture.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um, we used to have a juicer when I was real little.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	a juice making machine.
*MOT:	that when you would put bananas in it would juice the bananas, ⌈into
	pudding⌉.
*INV:	                                                               ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	because it couldn't you know get all the juice out.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and it was so good.
*INV:	                                          ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	it was the best banana pudding you'd ever ⌊have⌋.
*MOT:	but the juicer was a pain in the ass to clean.
*MOT:	so we'd never really do it all that much.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	⌊(be)cause⌋ it had this you know like real fine metal filter, ⌈that
	food would get stuck in⌉.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	you'd scrub and scrub and scrub and it wouldn't come clean.
*INV:	              ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	it was such a ⌊pain⌋.
*MOT:	but it was good.
*INV:	                                                 ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	so every once in awhile we'd do it and we'd save ⌊some⌋.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	I was carrying a banana peel one time.
*MOT:	on the way to class I ate a banana.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and I was carrying the peel with me (be)cause I didn't wanna throw it on the ground.
*INV:	                                             ⌈right⌉.
*MOT:	(be)cause you know I don't like to litter even though it's
	biodegradable and some animal would eat it ⌊anyway⌋.
*INV:	sure.
*MOT:	but halfway to class I looked down and realized that I'd lost three parts of the banana peel.

*MOT:	⌈and I was like oh well fine⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	                                ⌈right⌉.
*MOT:	&=makes:throwing_noise threw it ⌊aside⌋.
*MOT:	might as well complete the job.
*MOT:	so I was trying to be nice but, ⌈you can only do so much⌉.
*INV:	                                ⌊yeah⌋.

	if I swung it I'd almost hit myself in the chest⌉.
*INV:	                                                          ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.

	this big &=shows:size_with_hands.
*INV:	                                ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and so they'd always try to hit it really close to me and really low.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so they'd always hit my legs.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	every time.
*MOT:	if I either I'd get balls, or they'd hit me.
*MOT:	and I'd walk.
