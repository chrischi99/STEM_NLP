*MOT:	kinda strange.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	tell me more.

*MOT:	they have a fierce look about them and it scares away the other
	⌊birds⌋.
*INV:	mm.

*MOT:	and they have good growth charts.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so maybe it's their milk.
*MOT:	but even when um firstname and when it's a hot day he will say “oh mom”.

*MOT:	   ⌈a snake⌉.
*INV:	uh ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and it is um yuck.
*MOT:	I don't like snakes.
*MOT:	uh my sister was telling me that uh, just recently because she came uh to visit.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and sh-the last time she was here we went to the zoo.

*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and firstname was really like just he was so into that.
*MOT:	like the green ones and all the different colors and kinds of snakes.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and so this time when she came to visit she brought a sna-like she bought-she didn't.
*MOT:	not a real snake.
*MOT:	it was a plastic snake.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but she bought a snake to remi to remind firstname of when we went
	   ⌈and saw the snakes at the thing⌉.
*INV:	uh ⌊huh⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so it was kinda cute.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but it was a rattlesnake.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and it looks so real.
*MOT:	it's like oh my god.
*MOT:	it just freaked me out.
*MOT:	and it had a rattle on it and so then we were doing pretend with the rattle.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and we hid the snake in the couch.
*MOT:	and then we went and got a broom and pretended like we were getting
	the snake out of the couch.
*MOT:	and firstname was in on it with the rattle.
*MOT:	so she was rattling and it was really cute.
*MOT:	⌈but⌉ +...
*INV:	⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	but she told me-(be)cause she lives in north Carolina where they really have snakes.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um she lives on a lake and they have rocks down at the end of the lake and she would told me that the head the shape of the head is how you can tell if it's venomous or not.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and I guess if it's the shape of a diamond that that means it's venomous.
*MOT:	but if it's not, if it's just like a more rounded head um then it's not.
*MOT:	and now I know cobras are, evil.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	just because of that neck.
*MOT:	um that you know that they're venomous.
*MOT:	that they bite.
*MOT:	but I can't tell from his head if he's a diamond or not.
*INV:	                 ⌈uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	like I just know ⌊that⌋, you know.
*MOT:	so I don't know if that if that rule really shakes out or not.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else can you tell me?

*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and this I think they they're they're  normally not their neck isn't, spread out like that.
*MOT:	when ⌈ they are um⌉ +...
*INV:	     ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	like when they get angry or startled I think that's when their neck
	spreads out ⌈to say “hey watch out I'm you know a king cobra⌉ ⌈and
	I'm gonna bite you”⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*INV:	                                                              ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	or whatever you know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um so I think that's like their warning sign that they're dangerous animals you know.
*MOT:	or that they're danger, that they they're scared or they're after

*MOT:	they eat mice I think.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and when they eat something it's really gross.
*MOT:	(be)cause you can just see it go down and that's really sick.
*MOT:	and then they shed their skin a lot too which is interesting.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I don't know of any other animal that that does it quite like that.
*MOT:	that's scaley like that.
