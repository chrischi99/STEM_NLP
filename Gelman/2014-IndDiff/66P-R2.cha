*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	he's he's a power lifter you know.
*MOT:	although he seems pretty proud of himself.
*MOT:	he's a little top heavy.
*MOT:	a little unrealistic.
*MOT:	um, h-he's bulked up on his upper body strength but his lower body strength obviously is not there.
*INV:	uh huh, ⌈what more⌉?
*MOT:	        ⌊um⌋.
*MOT:	he's he looks like he's a Little Caesar's pizza guy on steroids.
*MOT:	yeah old fashioned barbell.
*MOT:	let's see you know ⌈mm⌉.
*INV:	                   ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*INV:	⌈anything else you can tell me⌉?
*MOT:	⌊no⌋.
*MOT:	he looks like he's a little too proud for himself.
*INV:	okay okay.
*MOT:	I don't need to meet him.
*MOT:	let's put it that way.
@G:	Lion
*INV:	           ⌈what is this⌉?
*MOT:	uh here we ⌊go⌋.
*MOT:	here's a lion.
*MOT:	a full grown lion.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	looks like it's a male lion because of its mane and everything.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um lions are one of our favorite things to see at a zoo.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	uh very exciting although once you get there they're usually laying
	around doing nothing you know.
*MOT:	but definitely one of the tops, to be able to see at the liv-at the
	the zoo.
*INV:	                                       ⌈uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	but uh you know reminds me of The Lion ⌊King⌋ because I've got little
	kids and we watch that quite a bit.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	uh wouldn't want to get close to one ⌈for obvious reasons⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊yes⌋.
*MOT:	but this one looks pretty tame actually.
*MOT:	doesn't look like he's ready for a meal or anything ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	uh huh uh                                           ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	let's see.
*INV:	anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	uh no.
*MOT:	just looks, that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
*INV:	great.
@G:	Frog
*INV:	what's this?
*MOT:	here you got a frog.
*MOT:	a little green frog.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	I don't know anything about frogs in sp-specific frogs like bull frogs or tree frogs or anything like that.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but um he doesn't look like your typical frog.
*MOT:	just I never noticed such greenness like a like you'd see like in a bull frog in a pond.
*MOT:	or one you'd see you know in your backyard or whatever but um.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	so he looks like he could be a little bit fancier I'm not sure um.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	not very particularly fond of frogs.
*MOT:	I remember one summer my aunt's house.
*MOT:	she has she's lived in a she had a huge backyard and there was a
	pool and it was just inundated with frogs.
*INV:	ooh.
*MOT:	and we were stepping on (th)em before you knew.
*INV:	ooh.
*MOT:	I mean like it was dark outside we were walking around and we're stepping on frogs.
*INV:	oh no.
*MOT:	dead frogs +...
*MOT:	and it was disgusting.
*MOT:	they were like they were like that big you know.
*MOT:	so I mean there's like hundreds of them.
*MOT:	so I'm not you know  I know it was pretty darn it was pretty darn disgusting.
*MOT:	and they were all in the swimming pool and everything like that.
*MOT:	they lived right behind the house was a canal.
*MOT:	so I think that's where they were coming from.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but you know.
*MOT:	not terribly fond of them.
*MOT:	as a kid when we would catch them I would never be the one that caught them.
*MOT:	I would be the one that looked at it but never touched it.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	you know the old wives' tale if you touch it you're going to get
	warts ⌈or something like that⌉.
*INV:	uh    ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	but no can't say that I'm particularly fond of them.
*MOT:	although again at the zoo I like to see the ones that are blue or red or whatever.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	those are fun for us to go look at.
*MOT:	and the ones that are like that tiny or whatever.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but behind glass they're fine.
*MOT:	I don't need to touch one ever.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	oh no.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Pie
*MOT:	I don't know.
*MOT:	let's see we got a very nicely made uh homemade pie here.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I can't quite tell what it is.
*MOT:	it doesn't look very juicy.
*MOT:	or cooked I mean the outside looks cooked but inside doesn't look very cooked.
*INV:	huh +...
*MOT:	I can't tell if it's peach or if it's apple or anything like that but um.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	definitely homemade I mean.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um reminds me of like Thanksgiving.
*MOT:	where we typically have pies and stuff like that.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	I'm not a huge pumpkin pie fan so ⌈fruit pies are fruit pies like
	apple and peach are my favorite⌉.
*INV:	uh                                ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	I can't stand like cherry or blueberry or ⌈anything like that⌉.
*INV:	uh                                        ⌊huh⌋.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	and pumpkin is the most disgusting pie ever invented.
*MOT:	but this looks pretty darn good.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um let's see, and you know and just another story as a kid I
	remember my mom making pie and the leftover crust she would put
	cinnamon sugar on ⌈and we would just go ahead cook it that way⌉ ⌈and
	it was really a lot of fun⌉.
*INV:	                  ⌊ooh⌋,                                        ⌊ooh⌋.
*MOT:	um but she didn't make homemade pies all that often.
*MOT:	but I remember the crust.
*MOT:	and of course back then I didn't like pie so I was I was always for the scraps so.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um and as an adult I have yet to make a pie.
*MOT:	we buy them frozen ⌈or we buy them from Marie Calendars or whatever
	they have around here so⌉.
*INV:	                   ⌊yeah⌋.
*INV:	anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	um no that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Milk
*INV:	⌈what's this⌉?
*MOT:	⌊um⌋, looks like a glass of milk I would assume.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	although the color's off.
*MOT:	um could have been lemonade.
*MOT:	but I think it's milk.
*MOT:	very full glass of milk.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um, uh.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	uh the dietician in me is saying you know high in B vitamins.
*MOT:	high in calcium.
*INV:	uh huh uh huh.
*MOT:	let's see um why don't you use low fat?
*MOT:	skim milk.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um, reminds me too of being grateful when my child got off of like
	nursing and she could drink ⌈bottled milk you know just regular
	store milk⌉.
*INV:	uh                          ⌊huh⌋, uh huh.
*MOT:	and especially when she turned two the littlest one turned two and
	we can all be on skim milk.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	because until they turn two they have to be on whole milk.
*INV:	oh huh.
*MOT:	and uh and I can't stand having whole milk in the house because it stinks.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	I can't stand uh the way whole milk just is completely different than skim milk.
*MOT:	I grew up with skim milk ⌈even as a kid⌉.
*INV:	uh                       ⌊huh⌋, uh huh.
*MOT:	um I don't know why my mom did back then because it wasn't the rage or anything like that but we always had skim milk.
*MOT:	and so like and my husband grew up on whole milk.
*INV:	ooh.
*MOT:	in fact he grew up on a farm and for a while their dad bought a cow.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so they-they're eight siblings so it would be easier cheaper to have milk and I can't think of anything worse than like milk straight from a cow.
*MOT:	especially the whole raw milk or anything like that but no.
*MOT:	and even when I've had to give the whole milk to my kids eww.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	I'm not very, it's kind of it's kind of gross to me and my husband
	still to this day prefers to have the whole milk for like cereal but
	he's definitely a skim drink- a skim milk drinker now.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but when she turned two I didn't have to buy it ever again and so I'm very grateful for that.
*MOT:	that's all I have for the milk so.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	King
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	it looks like a king of some sort.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um from oh oh way back.
*MOT:	you know I'd have to assume like sixteen hundreds seventeen you
	know sixteen hundreds probably.
*MOT:	you know kinda like a King Henry type thing.
*MOT:	although he doesn't look like King Henry but he's got the whole you
	know ⌈outfit of it um⌉.
*INV:	uh huh uh ⌊huh⌋.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um he's got this beautiful page boy haircut.
*MOT:	being facetious.
*MOT:	let's see he looks very proud of himself.
*MOT:	I don't think he looks very distinguished or anything like that.
*MOT:	he looks more just kind of silly than distinguished.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	let's put it that way.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	uh, the pipe I don't understand the pipe.
*MOT:	you know other than he looks like he's contemplating something but uh.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	uh, you know I-I'm he's got the shield behind him probably with like the family crest or something like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but I'm not I mean I'm assuming this is a fictitious king.
*MOT:	so um he looks very fancily dressed.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and not too young.
*MOT:	he looks like he's probably in his mid-forties.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	his hair hasn't turned grey yet.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but he's starting to get wrinkles.
*MOT:	and he's definitely obese.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Snake
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	here we got it looks like it's a cobra snake.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	because of the shape over here.
*MOT:	um whenever I think of cobras I think of that is it is it Tennison?
*MOT:	no one of the authors whatever.
*MOT:	Ricky Ticky Tavey.
*MOT:	I remember from elementary school.
*INV:	oh uh huh.
*MOT:	the mongoose and the cobra.
*MOT:	you know how the mongoose will eat the cobra or whatever.
*MOT:	that's I mean when I think of cobras that's funny that's kind of what I think of.
*MOT:	that or The Mummy.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	the movie.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	or Indiana Jones.
*MOT:	one of those kind of type movies.
*MOT:	um never have really seen one in real life.
*MOT:	I mean I think I've seen them at the zoo or whatever ⌈but I've never
	seen (th)em like on striking pose⌉.
*INV:	uh                                                   ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	which this one looks like he's ready to strike (be)cause he's all
	fanned out and ⌈very alert⌉.
*INV:	uh             ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	don't ever need to come near a snake.
*MOT:	grew up in Arizona and had a daily fear of running into snakes.
*INV:	ooh.
*MOT:	although I never did.
*MOT:	my friends did a couple of times but I never did.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	my husband's deathly afraid of any snakes.
*MOT:	and even like garter snakes.
*MOT:	he'll definitely wants nothing to do with it.
*MOT:	and my daughter was, my oldest daughter she was very freaked out of snakes.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and all of a sudden one day when we went to the zoo down in Toledo the snakes became her very favorite thing to see.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	I don't know if she'd ever want to hold one or whatever.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but like she only ever wants to go see the snakes now.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	and you ask her what her favorite animal is and it's almost always snakes.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	go figure.
*MOT:	I know snakes you know they're not very interesting at the zoo ⌈or
	anything like that but that's just one of those things⌉.
*INV:	uh                                                             ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	but definitely don't want to have anything to do with cobra snakes.
*INV:	uh huh.
*INV:	anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	no that's all I can think of right now.
*INV:	okay okay.
@G:	Police Officer
*MOT:	here is a female police officer.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and looks definitely from the mid-eighties.
*MOT:	uh, reminds me of my sister and her her husband.
*MOT:	he is actually a police officer in xxx [= city name] Arizona and she is a dispatcher.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	for the longest time she said that she wanted to be a police
	officer but I think she after four or five kids she's decided that's
	probably not going to happen ⌈right now⌉.
*INV:	uh huh uh                    ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	she looks like a young police woman.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um she's calling dispatch for something.
*MOT:	um outdated clothes.
*MOT:	I don't know any police officer that wears a hat like that unless it's like dress uniform or something like that.
*MOT:	um, she looks like a very dedicated policewoman.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	very serious.
*INV:	anything else you can say?
*MOT:	uh you know not particularly.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Surfer
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	and this is a nice cartoon character of a man surfboarding.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, let's see, he looks like he's having an easy time with it.
*MOT:	but then again it's easy when you're a cartoon character.
*MOT:	not too muscular or anything like ⌈that but um⌉.
*INV:	                                  ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	mm got some pretty wimpy waves going on there.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um when I think of surfing I think of Hawaii.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	although I've never gone to Hawaii or never have surfed that's just what comes to my mind.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	I've been to California at least southern California.
*MOT:	I've never seen any waves big enough to go surfing on.
*INV:	         ⌈ah, uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	um let's ⌊see⌋.
*MOT:	um never have been an avid surfer or need to go surfing or anything
	like that ⌈but it's something that probably I will try at one point
	in my life⌉.
*INV:	uh        ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	just to say I've done it.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	but I'll save that for one of my trips to Hawaii let's put it that way so.
*INV:	can you say a little bit more?
*MOT:	um he looks like he's very happy with what he's doing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he's not having any problems, ⌈you know staying upright⌉.
*INV:	                                  ⌊okay⌋.
*INV:	uh huh.
@G:	Strawberry
*MOT:	alright here we go.
*INV:	what's this?
*MOT:	a strawberry on the plant still.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, looks like a very ripe and juicy strawberry.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	just as you'd want to eat it.
*MOT:	we it reminds me of we had some strawberry plants this last summer.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	we just thought we'd do it fun for the kids.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	they didn't think anything of it make anything of it.
*MOT:	but we would get two or three strawberries every single day.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	just that we had three plants.
*INV:	ah yeah.
*MOT:	so you know what I mean it was pretty fun.
*MOT:	I mean some of them were tiny and some of them were actually normal size.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but they all tasted really good.
*MOT:	um they are the easiest plants to to to grow.
*MOT:	and I know that at least with our strawberry plants and I never knew this.
*MOT:	is when they first start flowering, ⌈in early spring you're supposed
	to keep picking the flowers off so that it doesn't try to grow
	strawberries initially⌉.
*INV:	uh                                  ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	that it saves all of its energy to grow more like runners and more
	leaves ⌈and stuff like that.
*INV:	       ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	so that they can in the end generate more strawberries.
*INV:	wow huh.
*MOT:	so that was a that was a I don't do any gardening or anything like
	that but that was just one of those things that we had learned you
	know when we were doing that.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and it was really true because as soon as we started you know
	started picking off the flowers you know the first month or so and
	then afterwards like I said you know out of three tiny plants we
	would get you know three strawberries every single day.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	all summer long.
*MOT:	it was pretty, it was a lot of fun.
*MOT:	and the kids liked it.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	so we love strawberries at our house.
*MOT:	we eat strawberries all season on all all all seasons ⌈and so⌉.
*INV:	uh                                                    ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	uh even the baby that's one of her favorite things to eat so.
*INV:	oh, uh huh.
*MOT:	even when they're more expensive it's worth getting because they're
	high in nutrients ⌈and you know good for Vitamin C and fiber⌉.
*INV:	                  ⌊mm-hm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you know lots of chemicals in it.
*MOT:	you know the the darker the fruit and vegetable the more like
	antioxidants and power it has and stuff so.
*INV:	oh uh huh.
*MOT:	so they're better for you.
*MOT:	so yeah we like strawberries.
*INV:	cool, anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	mm nope, makes me want to eat strawberries though.
*MOT:	oh and I hate strawberries and chocolate more than anything in the world.
*MOT:	when people dip strawberries in chocolate I think I think any fruit mixed with chocolate is disgusting.
*MOT:	strawberries especially.
*INV:	huh.
@G:	Farmer
*MOT:	here we've got a farmer woman.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um a little too stereotypical with the farmer hat.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and the uh the bandana.
*MOT:	and she's bringing in the produce or whatever.
*MOT:	um, not quite sure what kind of farm she's on although she does have her vegetable garden with her pumpkins and her tomatoes.
*MOT:	her celery.
*MOT:	her carrots.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, she's got the nice barn in the background.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I'd assume that she would have animals then.
*MOT:	you know she's got the nice barn.
*MOT:	and that's a green barn and not a red barn which is kinda not as typical I would imagine.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um although it is a cartoon character.
*MOT:	have to take that into consideration.
*MOT:	she's got bright red hair.
*MOT:	my goodness.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	uh she must have a green thumb because it's a lot of vegetables and
	the grass is very green so.
*INV:	mm-hm mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so there we go.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Corn
*MOT:	here we go.
*MOT:	looks like some Indian corn here.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um definitely makes me think of Halloween and Thanksgiving time.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	(be)cause typically those are used more for decoration more than anything else.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	I've never seen them growing in the field.
*MOT:	I would love to see what they look like when you know fresh.
*MOT:	you know I've only ever seen them dried just like this you know.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	you can buy them at the store stores at at at you know in the fall time or whatever but.
*MOT:	um, I don't know it just I guess it reminds me of well obviously
	Thanksgiving Halloween time or whatever but you know, ⌈Pilgrims and
	Indians you know⌉.
*INV:	uh                                                    ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	the whole Plymouth Rock type thing.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	eating the Indian corn.
*MOT:	(be)cause I'm sure you know it was not always bright yellow corn.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	you know when corn was first developed or whatever but um.
*INV:	⌈what else can you tell me⌉?
*MOT:	⌊um⌋, you know and the little darker corn pieces reminds me of the
	blue corn chips.
*INV:	ooh uh huh.
*MOT:	they're really good.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	which I remember when they first came out  you're like that's really weird.
*MOT:	but now it's the norm or whatever.
*MOT:	but yeah you know so.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	that's what I'm thinking.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Rabbit
*MOT:	um we've got a rabbit here.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	uh probably not your typical color scheme of rabbit that I would think of.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um it's white and brown.
*MOT:	more like a hamster colors than anything else.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um we get rabbits all the time in our backyard.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and they're more like probably jack rabbits I'm sure but they're always that darker grayish brown or whatever.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	much tinier and they got into our tomatoes this last year.
*INV:	ooh.
*MOT:	but this one looks like a pet.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	definitely looks like a pet.
*MOT:	um, uh we had a rabbit growing up.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but it “ran away”.
*MOT:	I still have never confirmed with my mom on that one.
*MOT:	I don't know.
*MOT:	but it was really funny (be)cause we had a dog at the same time.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and so the dog would carry it around by the scruff of it's neck and stuff like that it was really cute.
*MOT:	you know and they were pretty good friends.
*MOT:	but we didn't have the rabbit for very long.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but yeah I suspect Mom had something to with that.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	makes me think of Easter for obvious reasons ⌈with the Easter Bunny
	and stuff like that⌉.
*INV:	                                             ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	and especially with the season coming up pretty soon.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um would I consider buying a rabbit?
*MOT:	never.
*MOT:	my n-my niece has one.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and that's just the work involved in in that.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	I think there's easier animals to deal with.
*MOT:	like a litter trained cat.
*MOT:	or an outside dog.
*MOT:	as opposed to a rabbit that needs a hutch and a cage ⌈you know and
	all that other stuff⌉.
*INV:	uh                                                   ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	so.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but some people like (th)em.
*MOT:	I don't ever really need to ever have one.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	so that's it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Pretzel
*MOT:	um this looks like a I can't tell if that's a soft pretzel or if it's a really large those Bavarian large pretzels.
*INV:	mm, uh huh.
*MOT:	but I'm gonna assume it's a soft pretzel because I really like soft pretzels.
*MOT:	I'm not a fan of the Bavarian pretzels that are just hard and disgusting.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um let's see, um always been a pretzel fan.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um let's see.
*INV:	                                            ⌈what else⌉?
*MOT:	I'll stop at the pretzel stores in the mall ⌊anytime⌋.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	no excuse.
*MOT:	I'll just do it every single time.
*MOT:	um you know and I have I remember making pretzels quite a bit growing up.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um it was definitely like a home ec thing that we always had to do,
	          ⌈in like high school or junior high⌉.
*INV:	uh huh uh ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and they always turned out pretty darn good actually.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um again you know pretzels are fairly low in fat.
*MOT:	and you know have lots of carbs but you know.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	it's a trade off there.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I like the salt especially the coarse salt on it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they just they make a really nice snack so.
*INV:	can you say a little bit more?
*MOT:	um I recently found that that regular pretzels not the soft ones but regular pretzels dipped in uh hummus is really good.
*INV:	ooh.
*MOT:	(be)cause I've only ever used like pita for hummus.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but like pretzels they have that like that dry ⌈consistency that's
	really good⌉.
*INV:	uh                                             ⌊huh⌋ +...
*MOT:	plus it's a little salty too.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	really really good.
*INV:	ooh.
*MOT:	especially like the waffle kind.
*MOT:	you know the little square waffle kinds are really good for for hummus.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	so that's become my new snack.
*MOT:	I know.
*MOT:	so that's my pretzel.
*MOT:	there we go.
@G:	Owl
*MOT:	um here we have an owl.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um I'm not quite sure what kind.
*MOT:	I've never really seen an owl other than in the zoo.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but it looks like your stereotypical owl.
*MOT:	that you would like the barn owl or something like that.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	although with the striped feathers I don't know if it's a specific kind.
*INV:	hm.
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	owls have never been my favorite animal or bird or anything like that but they're one of the first, animals that your child learns to like mimic the sound.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	you know like when you're teaching sounds to animals it's like okay a dog says rough.
*MOT:	a cat says meow.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and a owl says hoo.
*INV:	oh uh huh.
*MOT:	it's just one of the only birds that actually makes a sound.
*MOT:	not among the chickens and the roosters you know and the owl.
*MOT:	so all of my kids have learned what the owl says.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um you know I think um there's you typically think of like a wise owl.
*INV:	hm mm-hm.
*INV:	anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	and they're nocturnal.
*MOT:	they come out at night.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and I remember in like seventh grade having to dissect the owl,
	whatever they do they spit up.
*INV:	                 ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	their little fur ⌊balls⌋.
*MOT:	and they dissect all like the mouse bones and stuff like that in there.
*MOT:	yeah I remember I don't know what those things are called but I
	remember having to do that and it was pretty darn interesting.
*MOT:	but so yeah they eat pretty much eat their their prey whole and
	then like spit up the bones and the fur and stuff like that.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	there we go.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	I know and I got to dissect them in seventh grade.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	you learn a little something new every single day.
*MOT:	but anyway that's that's what I got.
*INV:	okay great.
*INV:	thank you so much.
*MOT:	yep no problem.
