*INV:	                                                      ⌊mm⌋.

*MOT:	uh I think they're amazing underwater creatures.
*MOT:	they have again at the Toledo_Zoo a lobster that's really really old and it's huge.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and it's just you know if we would just leave them alone, uh it'd be
	neat to see how big they would really get and what kinda life cycle
	they would really have ⌈instead of how we breed them and grow (th)em
	and⌉, fish for (th)em all.
*INV:	                       ⌊yeah⌋.
*MOT:	and I'm amazed at how many grocery stores have live lobsters in their stores.
*INV:	oh yeah.

*MOT:	I think they're quite ferocious.

*MOT:	makin(g) a funny face.

*MOT:	uh go to hospitals and nursing homes and other areas that they can
	really bring ⌊pleasure⌋.
*MOT:	and uh we've been to a couple birthday parties with some of the local clowns that do just a terrific job with kids.
*MOT:	bring animals and do magic tricks and that sorta thing.
*MOT:	and, yeah it would be fun.
*MOT:	uh people that do that I think are very talented.
*MOT:	being able to, be mimes or just be silly, ⌈make kids laugh⌉.
*INV:	what more can you tell                    ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	um his outfit is just atrocious when you think about matching colors.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	painful to look at.
*MOT:	uh, a skullcap and funny hair.
*MOT:	flower in their hair.
*MOT:	um, it's an illusion I'm sure but short legs and a long body.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	kinda easy to do with a costume I guess.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	looks like he's got bags of, goodies on either side ⌈of the pockets⌉.

@G:	Cereal
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	bowl of cereal.
*MOT:	probably, cornflakes?
*MOT:	or something similar maybe Special_K.
*MOT:	looks plain dry.
*MOT:	uh, probably the best way to have cereal, without the sugar added.
*MOT:	we're kind of fortunately moving out of the, sugary cereals into more adult cereals.
*MOT:	I think that's, a good move for kids to avoid those.
*MOT:	but there are so many cereals that they can have that are just jam packed with sugar.
*MOT:	and it's really disappointing to me.
*MOT:	I know that I I'm just a big cereal fan because of all you can get
	nutrient-wise ⌈out of a bowl of cereal⌉.
*INV:	              ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	sure.
*MOT:	but I don't like to, start out the morning with that big of a sugar blast and send kids to school.
*MOT:	I don't think that can possibly be healthy.
*INV:	mm.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um, I don't know.
*MOT:	looks fresh.
*MOT:	ready for some skim milk and a spoon.
*MOT:	um, I like to make desserts with cereal.
*MOT:	I think it's another way to get kids, to eat it.
*MOT:	I have a couple good recipes that use Special_K and Rice_Krispies.
*MOT:	better than just a brownie.
*INV:	                                  ⌈mkay [= okay]⌉.
*MOT:	they have some nutritive value to ⌊it⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
@G:	Broccoli
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	ah broccoli.
*MOT:	mm, still looking forward to the fresh vegetable, time of year.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	locally grown stuff.
*MOT:	oh it looks fresh and, nice and green and, firm and.
*MOT:	um, we love to cut off the tops and then trim the stalk and eat that too.
*MOT:	uh, good in salads.
*MOT:	good steamed.
*MOT:	good with dip.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	something that, my kids are okay with.
*MOT:	they don't love it but they'll eat it.
*INV:	                                                        ⌈good⌉.
*MOT:	especially if it has cheese on it or there's dip around ⌊it⌋
	&=laughs.
*MOT:	uh something we should all try and eat as much of as we can due to its nutritive value.
*INV:	mkay [= okay].
@G:	Pilot
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	I don't know.
*MOT:	I think a pilot of a plane?
*MOT:	looks like you can see the control panel here.
*MOT:	and, perhaps he's talking to somebody who's behind this panel.
*MOT:	um, cloudy, puffy cloudy day but, clear blue sky <among it> [?].
*MOT:	uh, gosh I think that would be a challenging work to have to, ⌈be up
	in the air kind of⌉, kinda stranded in your spot not able to walk
	around and.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊mm⌋.
*INV:	                                             ⌈yeah⌉.
*MOT:	and and to be so far away and to have to fly ⌊back⌋.
*MOT:	and to have to live by the weather on a daily basis and, deal with the consequences of when things don't run smoothly or when times change or there's um bad weather that causes delays.
*MOT:	I think it would be tough to be gone from your family that much.
*INV:	yeah.
*INV:	I'd like to hear more.
*INV:	what else can you say?
*MOT:	um, without a mouth.
*MOT:	with a hand up.
*MOT:	it doesn't necessarily look like a happy conversation but, you really can't tell.
*MOT:	very uh, um kind of an odd cartoon maybe.
*MOT:	I don't know.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Orange
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	an orange.
*MOT:	looks great.
*MOT:	I just peeled one this morning for my son's lunch box.
*MOT:	I think they're such a perfect fruit (be)cause they contain themselves so well and are easy to and travel well.
*MOT:	and are always, offer you beverage as well as food.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	good fiber.
*MOT:	uh, certainly more plentiful in other parts of the country than here.
*MOT:	but we're really lucky that we get as good of a selection as we do.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	mm it looks pretty perfect.
*MOT:	good color all around.
*MOT:	shiny.
*MOT:	it looks from the outside anyway as being ripe and fresh.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Cake
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	cake.
*MOT:	yellow cake probably with chocolate frosting.
*MOT:	um, looks delicious.
*MOT:	some good fudge frosting.
*MOT:	I'm not a big cake fan but, frosting sure looks good &=laughs.
*MOT:	uh usually layered cakes mean some kind of celebration.
*MOT:	a birthday or uh or some other event they go to the trouble to make a layered cake (be)cause they're not the easiest thing to do.
*MOT:	but they sure are festive when you make (th)em.
*MOT:	it's a huge slice of cake.
*MOT:	maybe not quite a quarter of a cake but, going on it.
*MOT:	so that would be an enormous serving.
*MOT:	way more than enough for one person.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little more.
*MOT:	uh it looks like moist cake.
*MOT:	it looks like, fudgy frosting.
*MOT:	and it looks certainly homemade and, ready for a special occasion.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Witch
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a silly ⌈witch on a broom with a bat⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	and she's laughing.
*MOT:	looks like a fun uh Halloween decoration.
*MOT:	where you can have things like witches that don't scare kids as much.
*MOT:	she doesn't have an evil look on her face.
*MOT:	she's ⌈, smiling⌉.
*INV:	      ⌊sure⌋.
*MOT:	it appears to be a happy smile not an evil smile.
*MOT:	um ridin(g) on her broomstick.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	mm, what more?
*MOT:	reminds me of the Wizard_of_Oz.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	always, uh, enjoyed that movie, with the kids.
*MOT:	uh we have a similar uh form that we can put on a pumpkin and carve
	out ⌈a flying witch⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	so we ⌈do that⌉, for Halloween.
*INV:	      ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	I never put a bat in the picture though.
*MOT:	that's a good idea.
*MOT:	that doesn't look like it'd be too hard to cut out.
*MOT:	pretty simple, ⌈ pattern there⌉.
*INV:	               ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	awful green skin &=laughs.
*MOT:	and a typical witch robe and hat.
*MOT:	a little rumpled.
*MOT:	and her broom looks like it's seen better days.
*MOT:	but maybe that's how they're supposed to be if they're flying brooms.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Popcorn
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a bowl of popcorn.
*MOT:	one of my favorite foods.
*MOT:	looks like it might even be cheesy popcorn.
*MOT:	I could have a meal of popcorn although my husband doesn't agree so
	&=laughs.
*MOT:	a bowl of popcorn at night just doesn't cut it for him.
*INV:	what more ⌈can you tell me⌉?
*MOT:	where it could for ⌊me⌋.
*MOT:	uh, looks like a pretty big bowl.
*MOT:	good good size.
*MOT:	it reminds me of sitting down in front of a movie.
*MOT:	we do that, every now and then probably once a month have a movie night where uh, try and pick out something that everyone wants to watch.
*MOT:	and uh get out the sleeping bags and the pillows and get cozy in our living room.
*MOT:	and, eat popcorn.
*MOT:	it's the only time we're allowed to eat in the living room.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	and have some cups of water.
*MOT:	and, it's a great time, family movie night.
*MOT:	the kids don't wanna miss that.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um it's pretty it's you know a a fairly nutritious snack depending on if you make it yourself or if you buy it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and uh we buy just the kernels from uh the xxx [= city].
*INV:	            ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	it's out in ⌊xxx⌋ [= city].
*MOT:	and it's ⌈locally grown⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊sure⌋.
*MOT:	it's grown on xxx [= street].
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they have red popcorn and um, yellow and white.
*MOT:	and it's just really different.
*MOT:	it's really it tastes different I think than whatever you buy in the grocery store.
*INV:	                         ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	probably because it's so ⌊fresh⌋.
*INV:	yeah.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	so.
*MOT:	mm-mm [= no].
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Alligator
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	I guess it's a crocodile.
*MOT:	I was just reading in one of the kid's schools about crocodiles in
	ancient times were like fifty feet long.
*MOT:	and &=laughs I can't imagine encountering an an animal like that.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	um, I think they are amazing creatures though with all of the, body parts that they have that look so prehistoric.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and uh they've managed to maintain themselves for centuries.
*MOT:	it's pretty amazing.
*MOT:	and uh I would love to see one run but not too close.
*INV:	mm, sure.
*INV:	           ⌈what else can you tell me⌉?
*MOT:	at quite a ⌊distance⌋.
*MOT:	um it's got its mouth open.
*MOT:	it looks ready to gobble something up.
*INV:	                                                ⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	and uh they look like they have very very sharp ⌊eyes⌋.
*MOT:	and uh everything about them is tough.
*MOT:	their claws their feet with those big muscley arms and legs.
*MOT:	and that big tail that looks so strong.
*MOT:	and those jaws that look like they could really, really chomp something down.
*MOT:	I remember when I was in college some guys went to Florida for spring break and found a baby alligator.
*MOT:	and they decided that they would bring it back to Michigan.
*MOT:	and they kept it in their dorm.
*INV:	oh my goodness.
*MOT:	it was just a little thing at first.
*MOT:	and then it got to be ⌈about this big which it you know it wasn't
	didn't take long for that to⌉ ⌈happen⌉.
*INV:	                      ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	                              ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*MOT:	and even though this thing was only this big it was just a solid muscle.
*MOT:	and the guys couldn't even hold onto it.
*MOT:	so they'd have to flip it over and rub its belly and it would, relax.
*MOT:	and then they could, handle ⌈it⌉.
*INV:	                            ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	but they ended up turning themselves in ⌈ because they were way in
	for more than they⌉ ⌈bargained for⌉.
*INV:	                                        ⌊yeah⌋.
*INV:	                    ⌊yeah⌋, I guess so.
*MOT:	so anyway, ⌈that's [?]⌉ +...
*INV:	anything   ⌊else⌋?
*MOT:	I don't think so.
*INV:	okay.
*INV:	alright great thank you.
*MOT:	sure.
