@G:	Bird
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	eh but it's safe to be out there and boating at least at this moment.
*MOT:	and the dolphin knows it so he's leapin(g) around havin(g) a good ol(d) time with the nice day that's out there.

*INV:	                                                                 ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.

*MOT:	it's better for a perch to have, more varied shaped
	perches because um that's how it is in nature.
*MOT:	they don't just ⌈grab onto a perfectly same shaped perch⌉.
*INV:	oh              ⌊okay⌋.
*INV:	                                               ⌈mm-hm [= filler]⌉.

*MOT:	they would they would have a room dedicated practically.
*MOT:	and they'd have it all done up ⌈with⌉, make it like it's nature for
	the parrot so it felt very natural for the parrot and with branches
	and ⌈whatnot⌉.
*INV:	                               ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.

*INV:	&=laughs ⌈uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	so, it's just sometimes people slow down but learn to express
	themselves in different ways as they get ⌊older⌋.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	so that's what I see there.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	a good thing.
*INV:	great.
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	a saltine cracker.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*INV:	                                                        ⌊oh⌋ ⌈uh huh⌉.

	cracker in my ⌈house⌉.
*INV:	oh,           ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	because I had- everyone was telling me to eat saltine crackers.
*MOT:	and everytime I see a saltine cracker I think of throwing up and being pregnant.
*MOT:	    ⌈so I don't like that cracker⌉.
*INV:	ew, ⌊okay⌋.
*MOT:	I eat Ritz crackers.
*MOT:	they don't remind me of my pregnancy.
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	actually saltine crackers, the other thing is meatloaf.
*MOT:	my mom's recipe for meatloaf.
*INV:	oh okay.
*MOT:	that saltines are in.
*INV:	                   ⌈uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	and so this is uh, this is um, probably strawberry ice
	cream on a sugar ⌊cone⌋.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	yep.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so that reminds me of summer time.
*INV:	                                           ⌈mm-hm [= filler]⌉.
*MOT:	and, and getting ice cream in an ice cream ⌊parlor⌋.
*MOT:	maybe when you're on a family vacation.
*INV:	mm-hm ⌈what⌉.
*MOT:	and making a ⌊mess⌋.
*MOT:	getting it all over your face.
*INV:	mm-hm what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	and well with little Firstname  or Firstname ya know with any of these pictures I would be very descriptive about like ya know the shapes and the colors and.
*MOT:	but towards the end little Firstname was like “I don't wanna do the
	colors I don't wanna do the shapes”.
*MOT:	so then I would ask him okay, ya know “what do you see, in the picture” wh- you know.
*INV:	                                                           ⌈uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	“how does it make you feel” and different things like that ⌊so⌋.
*INV:	  ⌈mm-hm [= filler]⌉.
*MOT:	but um, ya know but ice cream always makes everybody feel good I
	⌊think⌋.
*MOT:	I always usually keep some in my freezer I don't know about you.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	I got some Dove bars in the freezer right now.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	those are good.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	those little Dove bites.

*MOT:	oh boy those are good.
*MOT:	yeah they're just- they're small ones too.
*MOT:	they're just small but.
*MOT:	there's chocolate ice cream with dark chocolate around it.
*INV:	⌈oh wow⌉.
*MOT:	⌊icing⌋ [?] you know the Dove ⌈chocolate around it⌉?
*INV:	uh                            ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and then there's the the cherry cherry cordial I was surprised.
*MOT:	I don't really ⌈care for that type of ice cream but with the dark
	chocolate around it it's really good⌉.
*INV:	uh             ⌊huh⌋.
*INV:	                                                        ⌈oh wow⌉.
*MOT:	and there's white ice cream vanilla ice cream with milk ⌊chocolate⌋.
*MOT:	so it'd go ya know kind of in that order.
*MOT:	and the cherry cordial and the chocolate I kinda like first and then the, um, cho- the milk chocolate one the it would be my last choice.
*INV:	                      ⌈mm-hm [= filler]⌉.
*MOT:	and then I got the bars of course that are like just the vanilla ice
	cream with the dark ⌊chocolate⌋.
*MOT:	    ⌈and I like that⌉.
*INV:	mm, ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	that's good.
*MOT:	I mean the dark chocolate goes the best (be)cause it's, ⌈bitter
	sweet and then you get the ice cream⌉ ⌈that's sweet and it balances
	it out⌉.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊mm⌋.
*INV:	                                      ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	if you just put the ice cream with the milk chocolate ⌈then you're
	talking- it's not like- you need that bitter chocolate with the
	sweet and they balance each other out⌉ ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	oh                                                    ⌊okay⌋.
*INV:	                                       ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	I'm becoming a connoisseur in these things.
*INV:	&=laughs.

*MOT:	so yeah me and chocolate I can go on and ⌈on with⌉, I can go on and
	on about chocolate.
