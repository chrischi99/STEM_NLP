@G:	Pig
@Types:	cross, narrative, TD
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	oh this is different than Firstname book.
*MOT:	last time they were the same.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	alright.
*MOT:	this is a pig.
*MOT:	and I believe they're called sows if they're female.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you can tell it's a girl because, you know I don't even know what those are called on a pig.
*MOT:	but it is a lactating pig so.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	it's very hairy.
*MOT:	I did not know, I have seen pigs but I didn't think of them as hairy I guess.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I'd almost call <it> [?] a boar but I don't +...
*INV:	           ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	it's not a ⌊boar⌋.
*INV:	anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	I did not know that they've got little, toe, I don't know, toenails coming off.
*MOT:	they've got a hoof and then I did not know about the little, toenail
	⌈or whatever that is coming off⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	looks like its legs are too small for its body.
*INV:	anything more?
*MOT:	ah you said say what comes to mind.
*MOT:	it looks like it would taste good.
*MOT:	for ham so.
*MOT:	that's, and we saw these at, the fair this summer.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	our ⌊kids⌋.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	that's probably all.
*INV:	great.
@G:	Banana
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this is a banana.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and my first thought is these pictures are taken kin-from kinda strange angles.
*MOT:	(be)cause, it does look larger at the top than at the bottom.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it is peeled I don't know three quarters of the way down.
*MOT:	and it's overripe because it is starting to turn brown on the banana and inside the peel.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	or that it was just left out.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, but I suspect it's overripe (be)cause the peel itself is deep yellow.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it would mash up very easily for a baby.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you can tell what stage of life I'm in.
*MOT:	that would be very easy to mash so.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	mm, nope it looks like it's a healthy piece of fruit.
*MOT:	there's not a lot of spotting on the peel.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that would be it I think.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Baseball Player
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	okay this is a baseball player.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and I know so little about baseball.
*MOT:	can't tell you much about the uniform or anything.
*INV:	uh huh [?].
*MOT:	uh the bat looks larger than I would've, thought.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it doesn't look to scale to me but.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	his socks don't match the rest of his outfit.
*MOT:	and it looks like he's got cleats which, I didn't know they wore in baseball.
*MOT:	but maybe they do.
*INV:	mm-hm, anything else?
*MOT:	nope I don't think so.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Cookie
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	cookie.
*MOT:	it's a broken cookie.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I suspect it's got some chocolate in it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	maybe it, that looks too big to be a chocolate chip unless it's a very small cookie.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but it's got chocolate in it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	maybe the Hershey kisses or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, crumbling.
*INV:	mm-hm, what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	I don't know why but, to me it looks like a moist cookie not a crunchy cookie.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but I really couldn't tell you why.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and I guess the only other thought was I'd probably count the crumbs with Firstname.
*MOT:	that's all.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Carrot
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	a carrot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it's a pretty skinny carrot it looks like.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um just because the green part is wider a lot wider than the orange.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	the tip is a little bit crooked.
*INV:	mm, what else?
*MOT:	oh I feel funny but the thing that comes to mind is that this would not be very fun to grate (be)cause it's so skinny.
*MOT:	so I'd probably cut my fingers.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and that's about it.
*INV:	okay great.
*MOT:	I feel completely domestic going through these.
*MOT:	that's all I think of.
@G:	Baby
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	okay this is a baby.
*INV:	it's a baby girl.
*MOT:	she has ruffles on her sleeves.
*MOT:	that's why you can tell.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, looks like flowers maybe on her shirt too.
*INV:	mm-hm, and what else?
*MOT:	she does have blue all around her.
*MOT:	which I think is still very cute for a girl.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and okay there's a little pink bunny so this is definitely a girl.
*MOT:	and a little baby doll girl.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, and a Snoopy.
*MOT:	she looks like, I don't know.
*MOT:	I'd say z- you know between zero and three months old is what I
	would say.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	well, one and three months maybe.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's probably, okay I'm gonna say, past two months (be)cause she's smiling pretty cute and they don't do that before then.
*MOT:	so that's about all for that one.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Painter
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	the first thing that came to mind is an artist.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and a woman that looks like she's probably, I'd say even sixty years old because of the wrinkles in her face.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and she has beautiful long black hair.
*INV:	mm-hm, and what else?
*MOT:	so I guess maybe she dyes her hair if she's sixty I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she is taking a black and white, it's not a photograph.
*MOT:	just a sketch probably.
*MOT:	she probably sketched that with ink and then she's, elaborating on
	it with her painting.
*MOT:	she's using that as a guide.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, adding a lot more detail.
*MOT:	a lot of color.
*MOT:	filling it in.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	I guess she just musta liked the shape of the tree.
*MOT:	(be)cause they don't resemble each other that much except for the tree.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and she's just done a lot of background work.
*MOT:	and that's kinda interesting the way the tree is growing on rock.
*MOT:	which I don't, that's unusual.
*INV:	mm-hm, anything more?
*MOT:	she has done more painting than this painting.
*MOT:	because she's got splotches on her smock and on the easel that are not found in the painting.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she's wearing a turtle neck so she's either older and cold or it's a colder temperature so.
*MOT:	that's it.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Cheese
*INV:	and [?] what is this?
*MOT:	uh swiss cheese unless there's some other kinda cheese that has holes like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	looks a little yellower to me than Swiss cheese but I don't know of any other cheese like that so.
*INV:	mm-hm, ⌈tell me more⌉.
*MOT:	       ⌊that's [?]⌋ +...
*MOT:	what would I say more about this?
*MOT:	I used to play in a playground equipment that looked like this.
*MOT:	it was Swiss cheese and you crawled in and out of the holes.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	I don't care for Swiss cheese so this is much bigger chunk than I think most people would want to eat.
*MOT:	it needs to be sliced some more.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's probably all ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	okay                ⌊great⌋.
@G:	Hospital
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this is a sick little girl in the hospital.
*MOT:	actually I guess she's not sick she broke her arm.
*MOT:	and the doctor's coming in, the doctor or the nurse is coming in to check on her.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	the doctor's checking her watch.
*MOT:	which I, you know I would think she's taking her pulse but she's not touching the girl's arms.
*MOT:	I don't know what she's doing.
*MOT:	she's reading her chart and, looking at her watch.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and the little girl could either look, a little worried or she could look happy.
*MOT:	it's interesting.
*MOT:	she could look either way really.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	well the girl's mouth is looking like it could be smiling but then her eyebrows are creased.
*MOT:	so that's why it's hard to tell I guess.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she has a call button on her pillow for the nurse.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, she, I-she must've, I don't know how they do casts.
*MOT:	but it looks like it was a pretty good break (be)cause the cast goes up past her elbow.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	maybe her elbow's broken I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything more?
*MOT:	I think that's all.
*INV:	                 ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	I exhausted that ⌊one⌋.
*INV:	great great.
@G:	Bread
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	uh, looks like wheat bread but, I don't know what kinda bread that is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but it's bread.
*MOT:	it's made with more than just white flour.
*INV:	mm-hm, tell me more.
*MOT:	uh I make bread so that's why I'm looking at this thing.
*MOT:	how would you do that?
*MOT:	get all those swirls in it.
*MOT:	I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's uh it looks larger than normal.
*MOT:	longer.
*MOT:	you'd get more slices out of it than, in a typical loaf pan.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, and they, um, put butter or shortening over the top of it (be)cause it's all shiny.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that would be all I can say ⌈on the bread so⌉.
*INV:	good,                       ⌊good⌋.
@G:	Duck
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	that's a mallard duck.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I don't know if it's just the way I look at these but again it doesn't look quite to scale to me.
*INV:	     ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	like ⌊the⌋ the body looks bigger than I would've thought.
*INV:	        ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	shorter ⌊neck⌋.
*INV:	⌈what else⌉?
*MOT:	⌊um⌋ +...
*MOT:	the wings looks smaller than I would've thought.
*INV:	mm-hm, Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he's got a black tip on his beak.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's all I'm noticing about this duck.
*INV:	okay good.
@G:	Puppy
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this is a little puppy.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	no idea what kind (be)cause I don't know these things.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	in between a short and long tail.
*MOT:	short ears.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	um, the expression is left to, ya know, you don't know whether this
	is a friendly dog or a, nervous puppy or, ⌈or a sad puppy⌉.
*INV:	                                          ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but I mean, it looks like a puppy that needs to be loved.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	it doesn't especially look too happy.
*INV:	uh huh.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	it's still little.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	I'd say within a few months old.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	between a few weeks and two months.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's it.
*INV:	good.
@G:	Pirate
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	got a pirate with a peg leg.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he has a bottle.
*MOT:	I think you know that he found a genie or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	on the beach.
*MOT:	he's got a treasure and a parrot.
*INV:	mm-hm, tell me more.
*MOT:	he looks like a friendly pirate.
*MOT:	which is kinda contradictory but.
*MOT:	perhaps (be)cause he looks like Santa Claus.
*MOT:	I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but he does have a patch over his eye.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	doesn't have any scars.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	don't see any tattoos.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	just he seems to like his parrot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they're probably best friends so [?].

@G:	Ladybug
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this is a ladybug.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	or an Asian beetle which bite so.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I don't know which one.
*MOT:	but it does look red rather than orange.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	ladybugs are fun to play with and fun to catch.
*MOT:	and the Asian beetles are not so.
*MOT:	so we try to be cautious of either one right now.
*INV:	                               ⌈uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	because we have beetles at our ⌊house⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but I have played with ladybugs and I don't remember their legs being hairy.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	maybe I have never looked at them close enough.
*INV:	hm.

*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	that's all.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Turtle
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this is a turtle or a tortoise.
*MOT:	I do not know how to tell the difference.
*MOT:	um, yeah there's my brain freeze.
*MOT:	(be)cause, if I were looking at this with Firstname I'd think “I
	don't know how to tell the difference”.
*MOT:	“it's either a turtle or a tortoise”.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
