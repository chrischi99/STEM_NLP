*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	in a hospital.
*MOT:	with either a doctor or a nurse or a PA or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	⌈ what more can you tell me⌉?
*MOT:	⌊<taking care of her> [?]⌋.
*MOT:	she looks like her face almost is kinda swollen.
*INV:	                             ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	and it looks like her arm is ⌊broken⌋.
*MOT:	and, there's a call button nearby.
*MOT:	except it's put by her arm that's broken which is kinda hard for her
	to probably get to.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] &=laughs.
*MOT:	um there, she's looking at her watch.
*MOT:	like one does when one's taking a pulse except she's not taking her pulse.
*INV:	⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	⌊so⌋, she's comparing the chart as to when something happened versus
	the time.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	can you say a little bit more?
*MOT:	she doesn't look too upset.
*MOT:	so looks like the other girl looks, looks a little bit distressed.
*INV:	           ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so I don't ⌊know⌋.
*MOT:	maybe she needs some pain medication.
*MOT:	maybe she's trying to find out when the last time she had some pain medication.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	um yeah.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Banana
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	this is a banana that looks like someone is just about to eat.
*INV:	            ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	it's peeled ⌊back⌋.
*MOT:	it looks like it's got a little brown part and stuff.
*MOT:	um, it's rather ripe ⌈um⌉.
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	it probably we'd get it on cereal.
*MOT:	I don't know if I'd want to eat it, the way it is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um it looks like it was peeled back awhile ago (be)cause the peel is starting to get a little bit crumbly.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and but no one's started eating it yet.
*MOT:	it also looks like they either cut off that part of the peels or, yeah bent it back.
*INV:	                                     ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	(be)cause they're not totally in the ⌊picture⌋.
*MOT:	so there are some parts of the banana that are missing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	um not much more.
*INV:	                                                         ⌈ okay⌉.

*INV:	alright.
@G:	Pig
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that is a pig.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	he's a pretty realistic pig.
*MOT:	he actually has some spots on him like most pigs do as opposed to the pictures that are always perfectly pink.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um, it would be a female pig who has some babies.
*MOT:	at least five of them.
*INV:	hm.
*INV:	⌈ I'd like to hear more⌉.
*MOT:	⌊um⌋ +...
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	it, is looking at something on the ground.
*MOT:	but doesn't look like there's any food there, from what we can see.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um so yeah it's definitely a full grown pig.
*INV:	nice size.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	probably lives on a farm.
*MOT:	and.
*INV:	  ⌈can you tell me anything⌉ +...
*MOT:	in this picture there's there's no dirt on it so that part looks
	⌊unrealistic⌋.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	this pig just got a bath before his this is a drawing so it wasn't a
	photograph before this drawing was taken, ⌈of the pig⌉.
*INV:	                                          ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and she's lookin(g) little bit old.
*MOT:	she's looking a little wrinkly.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so.
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	not really.

*INV:	that's alright.
@G:	Ladybug
*INV:	⌈what is this⌉?
*MOT:	⌊um⌋, that looks like a ladybug.
*MOT:	a very close-up picture of a ladybug.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so it's looking very buggish.
*MOT:	um, hairy legs and antennae and big eyes.
*MOT:	and looks like it's probably sitting somewhere.
*MOT:	the wings aren't pulled out.
*MOT:	it's not going anywhere.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	the ah there's a spot on both wings that comes together.
*MOT:	which I don't know if that's really realistic.
*MOT:	⌈I don't think that the two wings actually relate to each other in
	that way⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	I think each spot is independent on a wing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um there's some light coming (be)cause it's reflecting off of this ladybug.
*MOT:	um, what else?
*MOT:	I don't know.
*MOT:	it looks like there's some sort of neck part to this ladybug that I've never really paid close attention to when I've looked at ladybugs.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	⌈ so⌉ +...
*INV:	⌊okay⌋.
@G:	Baseball Player
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	this guy is a baseball player.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	he has just swung the bat.
*MOT:	and looks like he is lookin(g) to where the ball is going (be)cause he's looking kinda out in the field.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, and he looks relatively happy about what he just hit.
*MOT:	um, it doesn't appear that he's actually playing baseball because he would have his bat lower and be actually putting the bat down to run to a base.
*INV:	                   ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	so maybe he's just having batting practice and kinda happy about
	whatever he just ⌊hit⌋.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	⌊um⌋.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	he's, his clothes are clean so also I'm not sure he's really playing.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	(be)cause he's, hasn't gotten any any dirt on him.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um his clothes are all blue.
*MOT:	which usually people have white baseball pants but his happen to be blue.
*MOT:	and actually matches so.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um, actually has blue shoes so he's kind of, ⌈ all coordinated⌉.
*INV:	                                             ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	so he's rather dressed up so maybe it's before a game and they're gonna play.
*MOT:	(be)cause he's quite decked out for just going to the batting cages.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Cheese
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um that looks like Swiss cheese but it's very yellow for Swiss cheese.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	but it does have holes in it so.
*MOT:	and this is a drawing of the cheese so, maybe somebody was creating some new cheese in their mind or someone dyed some Swiss cheese yellow.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	what more can you ⌈tell me⌉?
*MOT:	                  ⌊um⌋, it looks kinda old.
*MOT:	it's been the edges are crumbly.
*MOT:	so it hasn't been recently cut and, ⌈well cut⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	it's kind of ripping, on the edges.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	anything else you wanna tell me?
*MOT:	that it's thin enough here that you actually can see through the
	cheese but these holes you can't ⌈see through the cheese⌉.
*INV:	                                 ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	⌈but if you had a thinner slice you could⌉, so +...
*INV:	⌊oka⌋ +...
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	doesn't look very appetizing.
*INV:	&=laughs.
@G:	Painter
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	and this is a woman who is painting a picture of a tree.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but instead of going out to where the tree is and painting it she's painting it from a picture.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	or a drawing of a tree.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	she has a, smock on.
*MOT:	um probably an old smock because the colors on the smock don't
	exactly they're not all the colors that are in ⌈ the painting⌉.
*INV:	                                               ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um but they do match the rest of the other colors that are
	splattered all over the easel so +...
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	⌈what else can you tell me⌉?
*MOT:	⌊um⌋, her hair is up but then there's a piece that's falling down.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so either she did that intentionally or she's it's later in the day since she put her hair up and it's starting to fall down.
*MOT:	and given how far she is on this project she could have been painting for a long time.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and the picture is of a, tree that looks good on one side but the
	other side looks like it's, kind of branches have either broken off
	or.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so maybe the wind comes on that side of the wall and, ⌈ pushes the
	branches a little differently⌉.
*INV:	                                                      ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	looks like it's sitting on a wall and it's, actually grown into the wall or something.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so, ⌈ that's that's what she's drawing⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊mkay [= okay]⌋.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	I don't know where it is.
@G:	Turtle

*MOT:	a turtle.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	a painted turtle.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	a very pretty painted turtle.
*MOT:	he's got yellow on his face.
*MOT:	and red around his shell.
*MOT:	and some red on his feet.
*MOT:	and yellow on his tail.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and, yeah it's uh clear how old he is or how big he is.
*MOT:	he could be little or he could be big.
*MOT:	though if he's a painted turtle he's probably not that big.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	I'd like to hear more.
*INV:	what else can you say?
*MOT:	um, he is, definitely, trying to move and go somewhere and looking.
*MOT:	he's not sleeping.
*INV:	                                          ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	he's got all his legs and head out of his ⌊shell⌋.
*MOT:	and, he doesn't look like he's scared of anything.
*MOT:	he looks like he's sort of just looking.
*MOT:	and, ⌈sort of looking up at something⌉.
*INV:	     ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so, I'm not sure if he's wanting [?] to go somewhere or if he's looking at something so.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	okay ⌈anything else you want to say⌉?
*MOT:	     ⌊but⌋ +...
*MOT:	he's a very clean turtle.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	his shell is very well demarkated.
*MOT:	he may be a young turtle (be)cause, his shell doesn't have any scratch marks or anything on it.
*MOT:	which an older turtle probably would have some, ⌈things like that⌉.
*INV:	                                                ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	he's a little wrinkly but turtles are wrinkly so.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I think he's probably a young turtle.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Cookie
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	and this is a cookie.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and it's crumbling.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so it's a very dry cookie.
*MOT:	it looks like it might be a chocolate chip type cookie.
*MOT:	but the chocolate part [?] has melted quite a bit.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and, it looks like it was probably a soft cookie at one point and then dried out given the way the cracks are in the cookie.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um but no one seems to want to eat this poor cookie.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	um and it's, yeah it's not very big.
*MOT:	it doesn't look very big.
*MOT:	it looks like a small cookie.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	looks like it's well, it's rather perfectly round so that part a looks a little store-bought.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um but it could be that someone's pretty good at making round cookies.
*MOT:	or they have a cutter to make it round and it could just be a actually a homemade cookie.
*INV:	                               ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	but it's lookin(g) kinda store ⌊bought⌋.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	um I can't tell if I'm looking at a picture or a drawing.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	it looks like it could be a poor, resolution photograph.
*MOT:	(be)cause <it's got> [//] it's looks like there's pixels in it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it doesn't look like what someone would draw but it's yeah poor resolution.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Baby

*MOT:	and this is a baby who is lying on looks like a crib.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].

*MOT:	and she looks about three months old.
*INV:	                ⌈hm⌉.

*MOT:	it looks like it's probably summer time.
*MOT:	she looks dressed for the summer.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	she is pretty chubby.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	like most kids that age.

*INV:	                                    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	but [?] probably talking in her own ⌊language⌋.
*MOT:	she's in a bed with star sheets on them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and, a Snoopy stuffed animal and some other a rabbit.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but I can't tell what he's standing on.
*MOT:	he doesn't really appear to be looking at much of anything.
*MOT:	he's not really that excited.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I'm not sure if they sleep with their eyes open.
*MOT:	maybe he's sleeping actually.

*INV:	what more can you tell ⌊me⌋?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, and he's standing.
*MOT:	um he's got some curling feathers in the back of him.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
@G:	Bread
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	this is a loaf of bread.
*MOT:	looks like whole wheat bread.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um it hasn't been cut so it probably wasn't bought from the store.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	though it looks rather long actually for a loaf of bread that you would bake.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	most baking pans wouldn't make a loaf of bread look like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, it looks very grainy, so it might not even by whole wheat bread.
*MOT:	it might be like multigrain or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um it's a picture.
*MOT:	it's not very an appetizing picture.
*MOT:	it's but it looks like the bread's been cooked all the way through.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	so someone cut off a slice but they just took a picture of the slice and haven't eaten it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and, probably (be)cause if they did they'd need to put something on the bread.
*MOT:	and they haven't put any butter or jam or, cut another slice to make a sandwich or anything.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	so and maybe they don't like the end slice so maybe they're just cutting the end off (be)cause they don't like it and then they'll go cut the rest of the bread.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	but they had a very sharp knife to cut it (be)cause the bread is very well cut.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].

*MOT:	they ⌈ make carrots all ready to eat⌉.
*INV:	     ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um so a lot of kids don't actually see carrots like this very much.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um and, yeah it looks like it was picked when it was relatively full grown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, and it must have been a good year (be)cause the green is very bright and it's not brown at all where it got dried out.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um and so.
*INV:	okay anything else you wanna tell me?
*MOT:	needs to be just chopped and, what is it?
*MOT:	peeled?
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	ready to eat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so.
*MOT:	or I guess you could just eat it the way it is ⌈without peeling it⌉.
*INV:	                                               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and he looks like he should probably have a good rest of his life
	with all of his chest of gold ⌈and jewelry⌉.
*INV:	                              ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and he's lost his leg in the meantime with all the stuff he's done.
*INV:	                        ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and his belt is full of ⌊ammunition⌋.

*MOT:	so maybe the parrot can talk.
*MOT:	and they, ⌈probably is one of his few friends⌉.
*INV:	          ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause he doesn't wanna have too many friends (be)cause if they his friends they'll wanna borrow his money.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so, ⌈ he trusts the parrot not to take his money away⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊okay⌋.
