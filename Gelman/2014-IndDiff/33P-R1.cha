	friend of hers makes sure he goes out of his way to take her to
	dinner⌉ ⌈and do something nice with her you know⌉.

@G:	Banana
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	this is a banana.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I do not like bananas.
*INV:	oh yeah?
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	the big joke for my mom is always that I was allergic to so many
	foods as an infant ⌈that she said⌉.
*INV:	                   ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	you know (be)cause today I'm like god I do not like bananas.
*MOT:	I just don't like bananas.
*MOT:	and she's like you know I think that's because when you were a baby
	⌈they wouldn't let you eat anything except mashed up bananas⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	until you were almost a year old.
*MOT:	and she was like and the first time I swear to god I gave you a baked potato and you were just like your whole face was like wow there are other tastes other than that.
*MOT:	that's awesome, why didn't we do this earlier?
*INV:	oh my.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	that sort of thing so.
*INV:	yeah.

*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	that's one of my favorite ice creams.
*MOT:	and banana bread.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	but other than that, don't care for bananas.
*MOT:	which is actually makes me feel bad sometimes.
*MOT:	because he really likes (th)em.
*INV:	oh yeah?
*MOT:	and so I'm it's not something I ever even think about buying or
	having around ⌈for a snack or things like that⌉.
*INV:	              ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	sure.
*MOT:	(be)cause I don't like (th)em.
*MOT:	but every time so now when we go to the grocery store if he's with me he's like can I have a banana?
*MOT:	and he takes one and he eats it while we shop.
*MOT:	and I still don't buy (th)em.
*MOT:	and I don't know why.
*MOT:	isn't that odd?
*MOT:	you'd think I would.
*MOT:	I know he likes (th)em, but.
*INV:	mm, anything else you wanna tell me?
*MOT:	nope.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Puppy

*MOT:	and so he's like I want a dog that's gonna just be my dog and meh
	meh meh.
*MOT:	and I was like you know first of all what you fail to understand is people don't really pick their dog.
*MOT:	the dog walks in and kind of picks their owner.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	it doesn't really work that way.
*MOT:	and he goes oh I know so I was thinkin(g) maybe you could just not
	be nice to him.
*MOT:	and that way he'll for sure like me better.
*MOT:	I was like have you lost your mind?
*MOT:	yeah okay I'm gonna agree to get a puppy that I can't be nice to I don't think so.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	but so now he tries to take um I my dog has a dog bed and it lays on my side of the bed.

*MOT:	I was like well we'll never have a cat because Firstnae hates cats.
*MOT:	but actually his mom um um she wanted to get rid of it and so his daughter called and Firstname can we have this cat?
*MOT:	and I was like well first he called and said Firstname is gonna call you.
*MOT:	she wants to know if we can have my mom's cat.
*MOT:	and I was like well what did you tell her?
*MOT:	and he's like I told her I didn't think so but if she could talk you to into it.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and I was like okay great so now I get to be the bad guy (be)cause I know you and you're not gonna let a cat in the house.
*MOT:	and he goes oh yeah no way.
*MOT:	and I said well again I am not having a pet that I can't let in the house.
*MOT:	I'm not doin(g) that.

*MOT:	you know of figurines and shirts and stuffed and you know and that's just his thing so.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	so I'd say that's about it on ducks.

*MOT:	at that time you were so sick that you just really you know.
*MOT:	and she said that It made me feel so guilty years later that that poor family.
*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	they lost her eventually.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I'm sure of it.
*MOT:	and here I have you and you and I have grandkids and I have and how lucky I actually was at that time even though you were so sick.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but um.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	mm, also the sick kids.
*MOT:	that's hard.
*MOT:	I was working I used to work at the hospital.

*MOT:	in the central processing laboratory.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and on the weekends I was the only person ever working who knew how to do the input of the records for um the pediatric intensive care units.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and you know for their records you have to go to them you know.
*MOT:	the rest of the adults and stuff they will send their records down
	to you ⌈and you input and send them back⌉.
*INV:	       ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	well they can't let those babies' records be that far away from them
	⌈even for a minute because if something they need to be able to
	&=snaps:fingers right then and see what's going on⌉.
*INV:	⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	so um I always had to go be the one who would go up there and ⌈put
	all the⌉.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	exactly.
*MOT:	and I was like alright I'll do it but if anything happens to any of
	those babies while I'm there I'm not going back.
*MOT:	but thankfully it never did.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but I did at one point um actually run into a friend of mine from high school whos baby was in there.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	and that was interesting.
*MOT:	because we were really good friends in high school.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I really haven't seen her at all since but I ran into her through that.
*MOT:	and I found out later from somebody else that her baby didn't make it.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so pretty sad.
*MOT:	but I guess that's it on that.
*INV:	okay.

*MOT:	except for the fact that I didn't grocery shop this week.
*MOT:	and now every day I know that he's.
*MOT:	you know it's awful.
*MOT:	it's almost like having a big child but because I get so mad and I'm like you know you're spending fifty to a hundred dollars a week on junk.

*MOT:	you know all day so.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	um, I don't know.
*MOT:	I don't know there's that much more to say about cheese except for it always brings to mind mice.
*INV:	                                               ⌈right⌉.
*MOT:	which should go hand and hand with what we did ⌊have⌋.

*MOT:	well this okay now a whole different thing.
*MOT:	I had a mouse in my car.
*INV:	&=gasps.

*MOT:	I'm trying to drive and he's back there going mom why you screaming, why you screaming?
*MOT:	I'm like there's a mouse in here.
*INV:	oh.

*MOT:	and I was like yeah but they weren't afraid.
*MOT:	they didn't care.
*MOT:	you know?
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so he couldn't find it.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and I was like okay do you think it left?
*MOT:	and he's like you know well I guess I don't know.
*MOT:	you may never see it again.
*MOT:	he was like I had a guy bring it bring one in here that had eaten all the wiring out from inside there.
*MOT:	he's like I don't know.
*MOT:	I was like okay great.
*MOT:	well then you know it got warm.
*MOT:	that was in the winter.
*MOT:	and Firstname's like they're gonna look for places to go babe.
*MOT:	you know I can't there's nothin(g) we can do about it.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	we live out in you know a rural kind of setting so ⌈that's what
	they're gonna do⌉.
*INV:	                                                   ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.

*MOT:	and I was like okay.
*MOT:	and he's like well you could start by not making it so comfortable for them in here.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	you know I have so much every time I go get the mail I throw it on the floor.
*MOT:	but um so I said okay.
*MOT:	so then this past you know I haven't seen anything obviously since it warmed up.
*MOT:	he's like they don't wanna be inside.
*MOT:	as soon as it warms up they'll leave.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	well we went to my cousin's wedding and we had a tire blow out.
*MOT:	so he went to change the tire and he comes back and he's cracking up.
*MOT:	and he's like I can tell you where the mice were living though.
*MOT:	and I was like nuh-uh [= no].
*MOT:	and he's like yeah underneath where the spare tire was.
*INV:	                            ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	and he's like there was all ⌊these⌋.
*MOT:	wait here's the really funny part.

*INV:	                                                   ⌈oh my gosh⌉.

*MOT:	except for that it is the one vegetable that my step daughter will eat.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	so we have to cut up carrots at almost every meal.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and I have since decided it is less an aversion to other vegetables
	as a power game on what I will eat and what I won't eat ⌈kinda going
	on⌉.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.

*MOT:	and she said okay last night when I fixed dinner they asked what we were having and Firstname said we're having chicken and you're gonna eat it.
*MOT:	shut up about it.
*MOT:	and he was like but you know if it makes you feel any better I'll let you pick the vegetable.
*MOT:	what do you want?
*MOT:	guess what she picked.
*MOT:	just guess.
*MOT:	guess guess.
*MOT:	and I was like okay, corn?
*MOT:	and she was like yeah can you believe that?
*INV:	oh my gosh.
*MOT:	and then she gave me some kind of boo hoo line about how she likes my corn but not your corn so next time you come over I'll send you home with a few cans of corn you can make for her.
*INV:	         ⌈oh my gosh⌉.
*MOT:	I was like okay well there's a big difference between Kroger and
	Meijer ⌊but⌋.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um, I don't know.
*MOT:	carrots always remind me of rabbits.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	um it also reminds me of my Aunt Firstname had a neighbor that had a um, oh god.
*MOT:	that had a rabbit.
*MOT:	and apparently they came home.
*MOT:	it was not her it was like a neighbor or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so anyway they come home and their dog's in the backyard just flipping this rabbit around.
*INV:	&=gasps.
*MOT:	it's dead.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and he's all dirty and muddy (be)cause he's throwin(g) it in the air
	⌈and catching it⌉.
*INV:	⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	and they're like oh my god what are we gonna do?
*MOT:	what are we gonna do?
*MOT:	we can't tell them that our dog killed their rabbit.
*MOT:	what are we gonna do?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they were like we just totally panicked so we took the rabbit inside and we cleaned it all off.
*MOT:	all the dirt and mud off its fur and kinda used even blow dried it a little to fluff it up so it didn't look so disgusting.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and left it on the porch (be)cause they weren't home.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	and so um she said I didn't see (th)em for a week or two.
*MOT:	and she said I was unloading the groceries one day and I saw her pull in and was like so how's it goin(g)?
*MOT:	and she goes oh my god you wouldn't believe it.
*MOT:	the weirdest thing happened.

*MOT:	a pirate.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um, that.
*MOT:	this is going to sound so strange but it reminds me of The_Wiggles.
*MOT:	have you ever seen The_Wiggles?
*INV:	oh, no.
*MOT:	there's a character named Captain_Feathersword.
*MOT:	and he's a complete idiot.

*MOT:	but they like it a lot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and he's very goofy.
*MOT:	and that's what it reminds me of.
*MOT:	and so he, Firstname is so funny.
*MOT:	he's one of the children that you know once he gets to know you he's
	very ⌈open and conversational and and stuff like that⌉.
*INV:	     ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	but he's very you know otherwise he starts acting weird sometimes like he's not sure how to act around people he doesn't know.
*MOT:	and um he also has very perfection issues.
*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*MOT:	he doesn't ever want to try anything that he's not already sure
	⌈that he can master⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and I had he was only like two two and a half.
*MOT:	and I bought him these Wiggles (be)cause he's watched The_Wiggles
	you know on.
*MOT:	they didn't have their own show yet.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	they would only have short videos on the on on Playhouse_Disney.

*MOT:	and he would just sit there and &=pretends:to_stare.
*MOT:	you know and he's the kind of kid who try and talk to him during his
	movie he's like &=makes:motions I'm watching this.
*MOT:	and so I said what's that?
*MOT:	try to engage him you know.
*MOT:	I'm like don't you want to dance and do the dances?
*MOT:	he's like no.
*MOT:	and I was like okay.
*MOT:	and he would just watch it over and over and over and just, riveted you know.
*MOT:	and finally one day he said okay I'm ready.
*MOT:	and I was like for what?
*MOT:	and he said to dance.
*MOT:	and I said oh okay.
*MOT:	and he turned it on, and when he got up when he started he knew every dance from the beginning of the tape to the end.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	it was like he did study it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and he didn't want to do anything until he was sure that he could.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but um, that's about all I have for um pirates.
*MOT:	I was impressed in there though that he knew the parrot was actually a parrot and not just a bird.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	I didn't know that he knew that.
*INV:	mm.
*INV:	okay, anything else?
*MOT:	that's it.
