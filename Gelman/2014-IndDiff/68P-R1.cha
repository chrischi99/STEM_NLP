*MOT:	so he has nothing to worry about.
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	mm.

*MOT:	lettin(g) the wind blow +...
*MOT:	and maybe he's lookin(g) at maybe at one of his other little babies or something.
*MOT:	he doesn't seem particularly tense like he's gonna go after anything.

	she's sitting next to her, car just kinda holdin(g) on to the door.

*MOT:	she's just kinda hangin(g) out with her car.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	I'm trying to visualize, the way the lights are on the, on the top of that too.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	(be)cause it definitely seems like a dated picture.

*MOT:	it could be something maybe even like showing girls can do anything
	from the fifties or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	there's a Barbie version of her somewhere.
*MOT:	but, looks very safe.
*INV:	⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	⌊very⌋ +...
*MOT:	I like the blue tones over it [?].
*INV:	can you tell me anything more?
*MOT:	well it's something that someone drew.

*MOT:	but she's never made the latticework on top like that.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	xxx.
*MOT:	it doesn't look very appetizing.
*MOT:	maybe because the color's a little off or something.
*MOT:	this could be from like a Betty Crocker cook book.
*MOT:	also from the, maybe I'm thinking because of the cop from the same time period or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I bet there's a lot of shortening in the crust.

*MOT:	he's just hanging out.
*MOT:	looks happy.
*MOT:	the waves don't seem too intense.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	tell me more.

*MOT:	xxx this almost reminds me of one of those things that Firstname has one of those computer programs where you can click and color in different colors.

	out give him blue shorts, ⌈with purple spots or something⌉.

	something the way it was photo-shopped out or something⌉.
*INV:	                                                                 ⌊mm⌋.

*MOT:	he's got most of his kernels.
*MOT:	very dried out though.

*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	really bad hair [?].
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	I'm trying to figure out +...
*MOT:	it's funny (be)cause everything else is standing up right here so

*MOT:	it almost seems like it comes from another, picture or something.
*MOT:	he's just kinda wrapped around it.

*INV:	okay.
@G:	Farmer
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	oh this is a computer,  seems like a computer clip art of farmer Jane or something.

*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	she's got all kinds of good vegetables in there.
*MOT:	turnips and carrots and pumpkins.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she's very wholesome but yet trendy.
*MOT:	because she's got the hot pink kerchief with her blue thing- [?].
*MOT:	the style of clothing almost looks like from the forties or fifties
	again.
*MOT:	it's fitted.
*MOT:	but she's just come in from the day, from the farm but it
	definitely only seems like “come on down to the farm get your fresh
	produce and you'll look as happy as she is”.
*MOT:	she's got fully red lips with lipstick on even though she's been out workin(g).
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	I dunno it definitely looks like its made it's it's a drawing that like an advertising agency did it.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	it's very slick.
*MOT:	but, the pumpkin looks like it's an upside down one.
*MOT:	I wonder if she knows it.

*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	mm-hm [= filler].

@G:	Weightlifter
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	well this is like another of those clip art things of a body builder.

*MOT:	he looks very very full of himself.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	showing off his muscles.
*MOT:	looks like he hasn't tried lifting it yet though.

*MOT:	he looks very soft.
*MOT:	I feel like his white fur is very very soft.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he's not like a Peter Rabbit bunny.
*MOT:	its he's not even like a bunny that you really see out in your yard (be)cause theyre usually all brown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but he looks like something from a little storybook or from a painting that would hang in a child's room or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	maybe even the same artist who did the lion.
*MOT:	same kinda coloring.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he's got a big nose.
*MOT:	but he looks scared.
*MOT:	very unsure.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	I don't know.
*MOT:	he, it almost looks like he's got like extra long fur up near his ears.
*MOT:	it's kinda funny.
*MOT:	he's got like a big crop of hair up there.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	yeah he looks soft and gentle.
*MOT:	but he, he definitely looks a little nervous, ⌈about what's around
	him⌉.
*INV:	uh                                            ⌊huh⌋.

@G:	Snake
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	&=gasps uhh.
*MOT:	this is a snake.
*MOT:	ugh.
*MOT:	he's got some weird markings on the back of him.
*MOT:	I don't know if that's like what +...
*MOT:	I'm terrible I don't know the different types of snakes.
*MOT:	I'm not even sure type of snake this is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	other than it looks very mean.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I don't know if that's a python.
*MOT:	but I don't know if that's the type of markings that would normally be on a snake or if that's just special for this guy.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it looks like he's showing it off (be)cause he's turned the other way.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I don't like snakes.
*MOT:	I don't like this picture.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	it's funny (be)cause his head his face almost looks like that frog, face from before.
*MOT:	it probably makes sense (be)cause they're both reptiles.
*MOT:	but he's they've got the same little ridges to it.
*MOT:	it almost, that little head there doesn't go with the rest of the body.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it seems too small or something.
*MOT:	I dunno.
*MOT:	too meek +...
*MOT:	but I, yeah I don't like him.
*MOT:	he's got lots of scales.
*MOT:	little red striping through him.
*MOT:	it's a pretty coloring but I +...
*INV:	can you tell me anything more?
*MOT:	I don't +...
*MOT:	if you take away his head you almost get like some kind of racecar track going down here.
*MOT:	⌈it's kinda funny how he's sticking out⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	but yeah I don't like him.
*MOT:	I'm not a big fan of snakes.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
