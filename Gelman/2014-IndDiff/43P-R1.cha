	football⌉.
*INV:	                                         ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	because I wouldn't want to get it caught in, someone else's you know.
*MOT:	or maybe the other team would pull her hair.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	I don't know if it would hurt.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*MOT:	but from the side it looks it looks like an e.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	can you tell me anything else?
*MOT:	uh she doesn't have any shoes on.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	it looks like she's missing her shoes.
*MOT:	um, and I don't think, that's a good idea.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she's playin(g) football she might wanna have some shoes on.
*MOT:	um, and maybe a, something something looks missing with her pants.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

@G:	Alligator
*INV:	okay what is this?
*MOT:	um looks like an alligator.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*INV:	                                       ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.

*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I mean there's a lot that they can eat.
*MOT:	I know they can, do some pretty bad damage.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, they like to live where it's warm though so we don't need to worry about them here.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	thank goodness.
*MOT:	although at the zoo they have a pretty nice exhibit at the zoo.

*MOT:	um, they're cute.
*MOT:	and there are so many different kinds of penguins.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I think there are many I I  I'm thinking of the penguins in the zoo at the exhibit.
*MOT:	they have many different kinds.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*MOT:	it wasn't really a, a big jump.
*MOT:	but it was, kind of I I swore, and when I saw him I thought oh I didn't know penguins can fly.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	maybe they can't.
*MOT:	maybe it was just a certain kind.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but it looked like it and I remember being surprised by that.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and um, and they like um, the display is very cold so I always
	⌈figured that they live out near the ice or⌉, um or out um, you know
	in Alaska ⌈you know where it's really really cold⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	          ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	um, I've never run into one or seen one on the street.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it looks like she's teaching, some type of math.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	or, geometry or something.
*MOT:	something that looks, complicated.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	she is uh drawing on the chalkboard.
*MOT:	and looks like she's referring to her book.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so she's, um, looks like she's referring to what she's drawn.
*MOT:	so there's a formula maybe that she's writing ⌈next to each number⌉.
*INV:	                                              ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	um that is, that's referring to the drawing that's above possibly.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um, so, maybe it's, I'm not really sure.
*MOT:	if yeah it looks like she's she's referring to um, maybe this is the formula to this drawing.
*INV:	oh okay.
*MOT:	that's what it maybe.
*MOT:	I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I'm totally guessing.
*MOT:	looks like something an engineer would know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	some sort of engineering.
*MOT:	uh.
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	um her outfit is not nice.

*INV:	                                                     ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause I was thinking she was looking at her book but she's re
	+...
*MOT:	maybe she's talking to a student while she's writing on the board, and looking at the book at the same time.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so she's multitasking.
*MOT:	which is, what everybody does.
*MOT:	multitask.
