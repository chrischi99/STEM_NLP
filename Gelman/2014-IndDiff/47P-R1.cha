*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything else you'd like to say?
*MOT:	it doesn't look very appetizing &=laughs.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	⌊um⌋, makes me think of when it leaks.

*INV:	         ⌊mm⌋.
*INV:	mm.
@G:	Firefighter
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	and that's a fireman.
*MOT:	fighting a fire it looks like.
*MOT:	although, it's kind of an odd picture.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, obviously he's in his gear.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he's up the ladder with the hose.
*INV:	mm-hm, and what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um, he doesn't have the face thing over him like they normally have on.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	mm, it's int-i never noticed how they used those on the ladder before.
*MOT:	obviously that gear or you know guides the hose.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but it doesn't look like he's pointing it at the fire so that's odd.
*INV:	uh huh great.
@G:	Race Car Driver
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	it's a racecar driver and a racecar but I don't really know much about racecars so.
*MOT:	um, doesn't look like it's during the race.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it looks like it's either, I would guess shortly before it.
*MOT:	but maybe shortly after it.
*MOT:	although it looks like they're working on the car behind him.
*INV:	mm-hm, go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	well I thought they wore helmets.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	when they raced.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so, it's obviously not during the race.
*MOT:	um, he's married.
*MOT:	you can see he's got a ring on that finger.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and the stadium is full.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I've never seen a racecar stadium so.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	it's weird that it looks kind of similar to a football stadium.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything more?
*MOT:	I don't think so.
*MOT:	I mean the numbers twenty-eight and sixteen they're obviously not
	on the same team.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but I wouldn't have expected that anyway.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's interesting that is says “family” up here.
*MOT:	I wonder why.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	but I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's about it.
*INV:	okay great.
*MOT:	it's obviously sunny he has sunglasses on.
@G:	Dolphin
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um, a porpoise or a dolphin.
*MOT:	can't tell the difference.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	although one of my students did a report last year to tell me what which ones [?].
*MOT:	I think it was the way their tail swam but I can't remember.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he's jumping out of the water.
*INV:	mm-hm, what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	the coloring looks more like an orca than it does like a dolphin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um there's something red on him and I don't know why.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um, the water looks a bit tumultuous in this picture.
*INV:	mm.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	no I don't think so.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Skunk
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a skunk.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and um, looks as though he's looking at something and I don't know why.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	and what else can you say?
*MOT:	I'm thinking about it.
*INV:	⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	⌊um⌋, it looks like maybe I don't know.
*MOT:	I don't +...
*MOT:	I thought skunks when they walked had their tails down.
*INV:	                                           ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	so it looks as though he might be ready to ⌊spray⌋.
*MOT:	but he doesn't seem paying attention over there.
*MOT:	he seems like he's paying attention over here.
*MOT:	so I don't know if they intentionally spray something or if they just-it's a reaction.
*MOT:	I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	great.
@G:	Pineapple
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this is pineapple.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, it looks like it's been off of its little stalk that it grows on for a little while.
*MOT:	(be)cause it's brown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's got lots of brown on it.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	I mean the things look kinda wilted so it would make me think that it, hasn't been growing for a little while.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's so funny you keep saying “tell me more” it makes me think about testing my kids, my students when I was teaching.
*MOT:	I really don't have much more to say about it.
*INV:	  ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	I ⌊can't⌋, I don't know if this thing down here is something part of
	the pineapple or something different.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	great.
*MOT:	it doesn't look like it's ⌈continu- like a continuous part of the
	flow from the top of the pineapple but⌉.
*INV:	                          ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
@G:	Cracker

*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	and what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	people eat (th)em with soup a lot.
*INV:	             ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	when they're ⌊sick⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Old Woman
*INV:	and what is this?

*INV:	                                                     ⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	it doesn't necessarily mean she is because she has a ⌊cane⌋.
*MOT:	she could have something wrong with her.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um she's a stylish dresser.
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	and she obviously has some kind of impaired vision because she wears glasses.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, she kind of has like a native american look to her.
*MOT:	and I don't know if I'm thinking that (be)cause of the necklaces and they look like they're turquoise.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and the cane looks kind of like it's got that +...
*MOT:	but it's hard because the picture isn't real clear.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so I'm not sure.
*INV:	okay great.

	of the pan⌉.
*INV:	                                                   ⌊mm-hm [= filler]⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*INV:	mm okay.
@G:	Ballerina
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like a little ballerina.
*MOT:	she looks happy to be doing whatever it is that she's doing.
*MOT:	I don't know what that is called because I don't know ballet.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um I think pink brown and hot pink are interesting colors.

*MOT:	I don't know what kind of bird it is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	some kind of tropical bird.
*MOT:	the way it's drawn makes the feathers look very um, doesn't make them look like the way they normally are.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	where they're like waterproof it looks kind of fluffy and airy.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's atypical.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	no not really.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Judge
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	this looks like a judge.
*MOT:	sitting on his bench.
*MOT:	and, hm.
*MOT:	it looks like he's listening to somebody but the papers would make me think that he's ready to deliver some kind of a decision.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	                   ⌈it looks like he's listening⌉ +...
*INV:	go ahead and say a ⌊little⌋ +...
*INV:	okay.

*INV:	okay.
*INV:	anything else?

*MOT:	it looks like it's something to write on.
*INV:	⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	⌊which⌋, or maybe it's a mirror.
*MOT:	but they wouldn't have a mirror there.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	I don't really know what it is.
*MOT:	and then the book, is interesting too.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	(be)cause I would think he would go into his chambers to look at that so.
*MOT:	I don't know.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Cat
*MOT:	oh and this is a cat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything more?
*MOT:	its legs look thick but.
@G:	Pumpkin
*MOT:	and this is a pumpkin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].

*INV:	what more?
*MOT:	I also never really realized the little white um, they almost look
	like bubbles ⌈on the back wings⌉.
*INV:	             ⌊mm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it's weird how, not his antenna but the other thing is curled.
