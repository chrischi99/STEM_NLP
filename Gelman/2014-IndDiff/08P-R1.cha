*MOT:	just because it was an adventure to eat.
*INV:	                                                     ⌈sure⌉.
*MOT:	so I found that when I find something I want them to ⌊try⌋ if I can
	dress it up in an appealing way that makes them want to touch it
	⌈and they're more willing to try it⌉ ⌈rather than just sliced up and
	put it in a bowl they might not have gone for it but⌉, ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	⌊yeah⌋.
*INV:	                                     ⌊sure⌋.

*MOT:	and got sprayed in the face at ten thirty at night on a Sunday
	night and we had to go do a peroxide bath and baking soda and this
	was of course winter so it was cold out and we couldn't have her in
	the house and.
*MOT:	it took probably three weeks for the smell to go away after bathing her daily.
*INV:	oh my goodness.
*MOT:	but um yeah we have a lot around and she's very curious.
*MOT:	and I found that the smell immediately after a spray is a hundred
	times more pungent than what you smell when you drive along the road
	⌈and smell one that's been hit⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	it's just, nose-burningly awful.
*INV:	&=laughs tell me tell me a little bit more.

*MOT:	it's beautiful.
*MOT:	um, reminds me of the aviary at the zoo in Toledo.
*MOT:	they have a terrific collection of birds that are close up that you can really get a good view of their feathers and their, kind of their living environment that might be typical.
*MOT:	and then there's another area where there it's a room where you walk in where it's open and they fly right around your head.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	and they're very very colorful and amazing to watch.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?

*MOT:	and not a whole lot good about them.
*INV:	                                      ⌈yeah⌉.
*MOT:	but they can slather them with peanut ⌊butter⌋ and at least put
	something mildly nutritious on top I can ⌈live with it⌉.
*INV:	                                         ⌊sure⌋.

	happening if you have a good seat⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊sure⌋.
*MOT:	but, not a sport that I would aspire to or I would hope that my kids would aspire to.

*INV:	what else can you tell ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	it certainly is a very popular sport though looking at the crowds here.

	⌈originally came from⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I just think it's just fascinating.
*MOT:	and uh fun to watch.
