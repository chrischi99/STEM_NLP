@G:	Alligator
@Types:	cross, narrative, TD
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	okay, now the a question is whether it's an alligator or a crocodile.
*MOT:	and you know it's interesting you can actually tell.
*MOT:	um I think when their jaws are closed alligators teeth are outside.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	I don't know if you knew that.
*MOT:	did you know that?
*INV:	well what more can you tell me &=laughs,?
*MOT:	that's so funny.
*MOT:	it's just you know when Firstname was doing this with me I was like what do you mean what more can I tell you?
*MOT:	it's an alligator!
*MOT:	no, I think that's an alligator.
*MOT:	and uh, you know a lot of these pictures kind of make me think of anecdotes and uh my husband went traveled to Florida and was looking at one of the properties that they work on.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and they actually saw alligators in the uh drainage ditches behind the shopping center.
*MOT:	isn't that nice?
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	that's a little, scary.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so we have quite a few um family jokes about alligators because.
*MOT:	well crocodiles really.
*MOT:	(be)cause my husband used to be into watching.
*MOT:	did you ever see that show the Crocodile_Hunter?
*INV:	oh okay.
*MOT:	did you see it ever?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	with Steve and his wife and baby and whatever.
*MOT:	so we have a lot of stuffed crocodiles and alligators and we have a Steve doll that talks.
*MOT:	so that's what that makes me think of.
*INV:	is there anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	um, no.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Witch
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	it's [?] a witch.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's a kind of cartoon witch, on her broom.
*MOT:	she has the stereotypical green skin.
*MOT:	she has some little bats flying along with her.
*MOT:	and she looks kind of rumpled and frumpy.
*MOT:	but she looks like she's in a good mood.
*MOT:	she doesn't look like she's having a bad day.
*MOT:	she has a little smile on her face.
*MOT:	but her hat is um, a little beat up and, she kinda looks, a little rumpled.
*INV:	what else can you say?
*MOT:	she looks like she's happier than the witch in the Dorothy and the Wizard_of_Oz movies.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	um, not much.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	no thank you.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Orange
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	that is an orange.
*MOT:	or it looks like an orange.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it could be a tangerine.
*MOT:	it could be a, um.
*MOT:	probably not though.
*MOT:	it doesn't look like the skin.
*MOT:	what are those things?
*MOT:	clementines?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that come out around Christmas time.
*MOT:	but I'm pretty sure it's an orange.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it looks like it's all polished and ready to eat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and um ⌈even though I just ate lunch it kinda looks good (be)cause
	I'm still a little hungry⌉.
*INV:	tell me ⌊more⌋.
*MOT:	kinda a small lunch.
*MOT:	pregnant woman.
*MOT:	hungry.
*MOT:	definitely happens.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	is there anything else that you can tell me?
*MOT:	the orange is casting a shadow.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's a nice three D representation of an orange.
*INV:	&=laughs uh-huh [= yes].
*INV:	good.
@G:	Cereal
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	looks like cornflakes.
*INV:	                     ⌈mm-hm [= filler]⌉.
*MOT:	or something of that ⌊ilk⌋.
*MOT:	breakfast cereal.
*MOT:	um, in a yellow bowl.
*MOT:	with no milk.
*MOT:	there's no place setting there.
*MOT:	so there's no implication that somebody's ready to eat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	just kind of a bowl of cereal.
*MOT:	we mostly use cornflakes for cooking actually.
*MOT:	we don't eat them a lot.
*MOT:	we're kind of a rice Chex family.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	probably (be)cause the baby can eat the rice Chex.
*MOT:	they're pretty benign.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	cornflakes are really good in those um, green wreaths that you can make with them.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	you know what I'm talking about?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you know how you make marshmallow krispies with Rice_Krispies?
*MOT:	well you can make like a marshmallow wreath with these.
*MOT:	and dye it green.
*MOT:	and put little red um cinnamon hots on it ⌈for Christmas⌉.
*INV:	                                          ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	those are really tasty.
*MOT:	I think anything with marshmallows are pretty tasty.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	but um I wouldn't be so inclined to eat uh cornflakes by themselves.
*MOT:	I'm kinda the kind of person who would put fruit or a little sugar or something on (th)em.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	now Frosted_Flakes, those you can eat by themselves.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but these are not Frosted_Flakes (be)cause there's no frosting on (th)em.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	nope.
*INV:	alright, good.
@G:	Clown
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	that is a clown.
*MOT:	what's he got?
*MOT:	the clown has its ears plugs.
*MOT:	it looks like a man clown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	because of the bowtie and stuff.
*MOT:	but I don't know.
*MOT:	it looks like maybe he's readying himself for something to blow up and it might be this canister.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he has a clown wig.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and a little teeny hat that's too too small for his head.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	with a little wilty flower, that probably squirts water or something.
*MOT:	he has very traditional clown paint.
*MOT:	white face and a red nose and a big red mouth.
*MOT:	and a big uh bowtie that often times spins.
*MOT:	big floppy shoes that are way too big.
*MOT:	and of course nothing matches and everything clashes.
*MOT:	so he has his um kinda plaid pants and a striped jacket and his pink top.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that looks a little more pink than red.
*MOT:	yeah.
*MOT:	usually though they're red.
*MOT:	red hair.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	it's like it's a um.
*MOT:	well obviously clowns are at the circus.
*MOT:	and uh, it looks like it's one of the happy clowns.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you know, I don't think it's a rodeo clown (be)cause it's not really dressed the right way to be a rodeo clown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I think that's a circus clown.
*MOT:	and of course they're almost never alone.
*MOT:	you know they always have another clown around.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm⌉ [= filler].
*MOT:	⌊so⌋, he's missing his little buddies.
*MOT:	but he looks like he's readying himself for something loud to explode.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	can you say anything more?
*MOT:	I just wonder what that barrel is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and what's going to make the loud noise.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I remember the first time I went to a circus.
*MOT:	do you remember, the first time you went to the circus?
*INV:	I don't think so.
*MOT:	I remember the first time I went to the circus and I remember the first time I took my kids to the circus (be)cause it was last year.
*MOT:	it was really fun.
*MOT:	I liked it.
*MOT:	we put Firstname up on the elephant.
*INV:	                       ⌈mm⌉, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	do the little elephant ⌊ride⌋.
*MOT:	I went with my grandparents the first time.
*MOT:	down in xxx [= city].
*MOT:	in western Michigan so.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	some kids are really scared of clowns though.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and I don't think I was and Firstname certainly wasn't.
*MOT:	he's not a kid that's scared of many things.
*MOT:	(be)cause we have explained the difference between pretend and real to him a lot of times.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
@G:	Pilot
*MOT:	um this looks like an airline pilot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	of course it's not a real picture.
*MOT:	it is a drawing.
*MOT:	representational drawing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, looks like he +...
*MOT:	does look like a man.
*MOT:	shorter hair.
*MOT:	looks like he is taking to somebody or acknowledging somebody or something.
*MOT:	but you can't see anybody else in the picture.
*MOT:	you can't see a copilot or who he might be speaking to out here.
*MOT:	looks like it's a pretty good weather day.
*MOT:	there's only a couple little clouds.
*MOT:	and the sky is light.
*MOT:	it doesn't look like it's dark or anything.
*MOT:	it looks like it might be day time.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and pretty good weather.
*MOT:	and uh you have no of course no indication where he's flying.
*MOT:	or where he's been or where he's going to which just.
*MOT:	actually you know though I have to tell you truthfully that's not the correct number of stripes for a captain.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	his hat doesn't match his uniform.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they're different colors of blue.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he has no fingers.
*MOT:	he has no detail to him, um his face.
*MOT:	he just has an eye.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he has no fingers.
*MOT:	and no mouth.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, you can't tell whether he's actually flying right now or.
*MOT:	I guess, he could be on the ground but I doubt it.
*MOT:	(be)cause there would probably be buildings or something.
*MOT:	he's probably flying.
*MOT:	but what's he doing not paying attention?
*MOT:	I don't have anything else to say about our pilot.
*INV:	okay good.
@G:	Lobster
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	lobster.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I don't like lobster.
*MOT:	I don't like how they taste.
*MOT:	I don't like how they smell when they cook.
*MOT:	I don't like their little pinchers.
*MOT:	I don't like their little antenna.
*MOT:	I don't like anything really about them.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	last time I was really around lobster any to extent any extent was New Year's Eve two years ago.
*MOT:	uh and my friends brought over lobster for dinner.
*MOT:	I had steak.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but they um, did a big lobster boil in the garage.
*MOT:	(be)cause I wasn't letting them cook (th)em in the house.
*MOT:	and they put the lobsters down and raced (th)em a little bit.
*MOT:	I'm glad you find that funny.
*MOT:	we did.
*MOT:	if you drink enough wine anything is funny.
*MOT:	um but I don't really I mean I obviously I think of them more in a food sense.
*MOT:	although we just went to um the Field_Museum in not the Field_Museum.
*MOT:	the Shedd_Aquarium in uh Chicago a couple um in the beginning of December.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and we saw this whole, exhibit on crabs and crustaceans.
*MOT:	and the difference between lobsters and crabs.
*INV:	                             ⌈tell me more⌉.
*MOT:	but still I think of them as ⌊food⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that I don't like.
*INV:	anything more?
*MOT:	mm, no.
*INV:	okay good.
@G:	Teacher
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	looks like a geometry instructor.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it looks like a seventies version of a geometry instructor.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's nice to see that it's a woman.
*MOT:	because I think it's really important to have women in the maths and sciences.
*MOT:	and um, but I'm just I'm laughing because of her clothes.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you know the turquoise blazer with the royal blue skirt with the pink heels.
*MOT:	and who wears heels to lecture anyway?
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	it's the transitive property.
*MOT:	if angle R equals angle T and angle S equals angle T.
*MOT:	therefore angle R equals angle S.
*MOT:	but I was looking (be)cause it doesn't look like the representation of the drawing.
*MOT:	angles T and S are are going to equal because they're parallel lines.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but angles R and T do not look like they equal each other.
*MOT:	so it's kinda hard to tell from the drawing.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	um but it's the transitive property.
*MOT:	that's what she's teaching about.
*MOT:	it's like if A equals B and B equals C therefore A equals C.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and there's lots of proofs about that one.
*MOT:	I can't believe I remembered that.
*MOT:	mister Firstname would be oh so proud.
*MOT:	he was my geometry teacher in ninth grade.
*INV:	anything more?
*MOT:	she looks like she's a happy academic.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	kind of got her glasses on.
*MOT:	has her lecture notes.
*MOT:	she's smiling.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	do they even use chalkboards in schools anymore?
*INV:	I don't know.
*MOT:	I think mostly I mean isn't it whiteboards now?
*INV:	yeah.
@G:	Cake
*MOT:	yum.
*MOT:	just like Firstname.
*MOT:	firstname's like yummy yummy yummy.
*MOT:	um looks like yellow cake.
*MOT:	with chocolate icing.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and um, anything with chocolate is good.
*MOT:	although I prefer chocolate cake with white icing.
*MOT:	and I like white cake with chocolate icing.
*MOT:	or yellow cake with chocolate icing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's a good combo there.
*MOT:	especially if it's good fudgy chocolate cake.
*MOT:	and it looks like it has a hole in it where somebody took a candle out.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	it's a nice thick piece cut.
*MOT:	musta been somebody's birthday if there's a candle in it.
*MOT:	since I just had my birthday I think cake sounds pretty good.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	I don't think I've ever made a yellow cake from scratch.
*MOT:	I think I've only ever used a box.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I've made several chocolate cakes from scratch.
*MOT:	but I don't really bake much anymore because I don't really have time.
*MOT:	and my husband's diabetic so we don't get a lot of sweets like that.
*MOT:	but it looks good.
*MOT:	looks like a nice yummy piece of cake.
*MOT:	good enough to eat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler] good.
@G:	Elephant
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	it looks like a young elephant.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	not sure whether it's a male.
*MOT:	obviously I know that because of the tusks.
*MOT:	but I'm not sure whether it's Asian or Indian variety (be)cause I never can remember which ears are which.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but it looks like a young male.
*MOT:	his tusks aren't super long and he doesn't look like he's got the bulk yet of the older males.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and um, he looks really sweet.
*MOT:	elephants are smart.
*MOT:	they're really really um, family oriented.
*MOT:	they um, you know that whole elephant graveyard thing?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	there's truth to that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	like I've actually see them in the wilderness and the savanna and they're amazing.
*MOT:	they're beautiful creatures.
*MOT:	they're huge.
*MOT:	and the littles ones are so cute.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they call (th)em totos.
*MOT:	that's what a baby elephant is.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	you know like a kitty and a cat.
*MOT:	and a you know a puppy and a dog.
*MOT:	a toto and an elephant.
*MOT:	you know and a.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	it's like uh the males are one thing and the females are the other.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	anyway, this looks like a young male.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	I just I loved seeing them you know au natural and not in cages and I understand the need for research at zoos and stuff but it makes me sad.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it makes me sad that their natural habitat is diminishing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	it's kinda loud out there.
*MOT:	okay answering machine.
*MOT:	and I thought it was Firstname's maybe.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so, I have nothing else to say.
*MOT:	he still has his horns which is, his tusks excuse me, which is nice.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it means hopefully he's safe.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	the poachers are so horrible.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they kill them for their tusks and they just leave (th)em.
*INV:	yeah.
@G:	Penguin
*INV:	that looks like a penguin variety.
*MOT:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, I'm not real good about knowing whether your penguins are your arctic or your Antarctic.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I just, it looks like a penguin to me.
*MOT:	it's a pretty nice illustration.
*MOT:	just like the elephant was it has you know lots of detail to it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	we just watched a movie recently about, me and Firstname, about the little snow bear and he's befriended befriends a uh, befriends a penguin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he gets it so that all the polar bears aren't going to eat the penguins.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, aren't going to eat the seals and.
*MOT:	but it's a nice little illustration.
*MOT:	it would be strange to see a penguin in isolation like this because usually they, they're in the colonies and stuff.
*MOT:	did you know, that the penguins, three penguins from the Detroit_Zoo just had cataract surgery?
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	yeah.
*MOT:	it was in the papers.
*MOT:	um they had it at a you know like a veterinary ophthalmologist or something like that and.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they kept running into walls and they couldn't see the food.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	so, they did the cataract surgery for them.
*MOT:	so that it was pretty amusing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but I appreciate that they wanted to save them.
*INV:	good.
@G:	Broccoli
*MOT:	broccoli is pretty much our family uh staple vegetable.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	broccoli like once a week at a minimum.
*MOT:	and it's of course really good for you.
*MOT:	it's a good cancer preventing agent.
*MOT:	it needs to be cleaned and get ready to cook (be)cause it's still got its leaves and most of its stem on it.
*MOT:	we cook ours in little bit smaller pieces.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	make (th)em into little whatever floret's.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	my boys both eat it really well and +...
*MOT:	so that makes me happy as a mom.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's a good vegetable for them to do a good job with.
*MOT:	and, course, broccoli wouldn't be broccoli if you didn't say you liked it best with cheese on it.
*MOT:	but we don't eat it that way ninety nine percent of the time so.
*MOT:	but it looks like nice fresh broccoli and it looks like it's ready to cook.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	we're having asparagus for dinner tonight.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	no.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Horse
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	looks like a colt.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	a pretty newborn horse.
*MOT:	looks like a bay color.
*MOT:	can't tell whether it's a, what do you call it?
*MOT:	a mare, or a stallion.
*MOT:	(be)cause I don't think they geld them that little.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you know it's really interesting.
*MOT:	I said colt but I don't know what the difference between a foal and a colt is.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	so I'm not sure which is the appropriate term.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	(be)cause we went to xxx [= farm] and they did a little educating of us in regards to cows.
*INV:	mm, uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so heifers are cows, heifers are bovine that have not had babies.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	but female that have not had babies.
*MOT:	and, um cows have had babies.
*INV:	whoa.
*MOT:	then there's um steer and bulls.
*INV:	whoa.
*MOT:	yeah.
*MOT:	so we just call everything a cow.
*INV:	yeah, yeah.
*MOT:	but you know farmers don't do that.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	people who keep, ranchers don't do that.
*MOT:	so that's why I say I don't know whether this is a colt or a foal.
*MOT:	I don't know whether it's a boy or a girl.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	looks pretty regal.
*MOT:	very pretty little colt or foal whichever it is.
*MOT:	and I don't really have anything else to observe about it.
*INV:	okay, good.
@G:	Popcorn
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	popcorn.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	ready for the Superbowl on Sunday.
*MOT:	my boys are popcorn freaks.
*MOT:	they love popcorn.
*MOT:	try and do the air popcorn variety instead of the microwave variety (be)cause it's less calories.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and um of course though that they still will to melt butter and
	&=pours:butter.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	my husband is a movie popcorn freak.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	we cannot go to a movie without him buying like the gigantic humongous bag.
*MOT:	and I eat a little bit of it but um.
*MOT:	you know my boys are popcorn freaks.
*MOT:	of course he's gonna tell me mom can we have popcorn as a snack?
*MOT:	(be)cause this'll prompt him.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	(be)cause I think he looks at the same pictures, right?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it looks good though.
*MOT:	hopefully it's not stale.
*MOT:	stale popcorn's yucky.
*INV:	mm, tell me more.
*MOT:	hot buttered salted popcorn.
*MOT:	what can you beat?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I like some of the caramel corn too.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	(be)cause now you can go to those stores and you can buy it raspberry flavored and blueberry flavored.
*MOT:	this just looks like plain old fashioned home popcorn.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but if you had to ask me to pop it in oil on the stove forget it.
*MOT:	can't do it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I can use the air popper and I can use the microwave.
*MOT:	uh I don't know how to do that the other way.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	you I don't know if you're young old enough to remember where they had poppers, excuse me, that you dropped oil in the bottom and you put the seeds in.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and they had a lid on them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I guess it's the same way as doing it on the stove but anyway.
*MOT:	the air popper is so much easier.
*INV:	yeah.
@G:	Football Player
*INV:	and what is this?
*MOT:	it's an illustration of a football player.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	number three.
*MOT:	um, what's funny to me, it's just a horrible drawing.
*MOT:	um first of all I mean obviously there's no cleats or no appropriate athletic shoes.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	nice socks that match the jerseys but it doesn't look like the
	players really well padded ⌈in the shoulders or the legs⌉.
*INV:	                           ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*MOT:	there's no mouth guard.
*MOT:	and it looks like it's a girl.
*MOT:	which, I don't have any problem with women playing football but it just doesn't happen really much, very much.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and, looks like it's a right handed person passing the ball.
*MOT:	(be)cause, it's going back for the pass.
*INV:	and um.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	there's no team name or any designations on the helmet.
*MOT:	well there's some marking on the helmet but you really can't tell.
*MOT:	so it just looks like number three is passing the ball on the blue team.
*MOT:	might say it would be the quarterback if it wasn't somebody else passing the ball.
*MOT:	and again it's kind of devoid of a lot of detail.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	some of the other characature type or illustration type drawings versus the pictures.
*MOT:	so, big football fan.
*MOT:	there's no field.
*MOT:	there's no stands.
*MOT:	there's no crowd.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	there's no team members.
*MOT:	it's just a person standing there.
*INV:	                                              ⌈anything else⌉?
*MOT:	looking like they're about ready to throw the ⌊ball⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	okay, good.
*INV:	thank you very much for doing that.
*INV:	I learned a lot of new things today.
