@Types:	cross, narrative, TD
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um a bird.
*MOT:	a parrot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	they live a long time.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	uh so anybody who gets a parrot or a bird like this needs to be prepared for it to probably outlive them.
*INV:	can you say a little bit more?
*MOT:	uh, I, parrots are one of the prettier colors ⌈ um of birds that are
	there⌉.
*INV:	                                              ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I know they can have quite a few colors on them.
*MOT:	um they can speak.
*MOT:	they're one of the few birds that can imitate uh the human voice or
	the human, ⌈words⌉.
*INV:	           ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	they can they can imitate.
*MOT:	it's debatable if they really understand what they're saying or not.
*MOT:	but they can speak.
*MOT:	that's, that's about all I know.
*INV:	okay.
*INV:	that was great.
@G:	Firefighter
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	uh a fireman.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and it looks like he is trying to put out a fire on a ladder.
*INV:	hm, ⌈what else can you tell me⌉?
*MOT:	    ⌊um⌋, he's doing something with the hose.
*MOT:	I don't see any water coming out of that hose ⌈so I don't know what
	what that is he's using⌉.
*INV:	                                              ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but um.
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	uh, he's in his uniform.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but he must not be too concerned or this picture was taken before they had all the gas masks and everything.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	for people working right up next to the smoke and the fire.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	he could probably be more protected than what he is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] mm hm.
*MOT:	but it looks like he's on the job.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Skunk
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	this is a skunk.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they're I think probably the most smelly animals known.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, I think they're cute.
*MOT:	not many people do.
*INV:	oh.
*INV:	I'd like to hear more.
*INV:	what else can you say?
*MOT:	um just I I just I think they're cute.
*MOT:	you don't see (th)em that often unless you see them hit hit on the
	road then you smell them probably before you see (th)em.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	but I just I don't know.
*MOT:	I think they're kinda neat.
*MOT:	neat little animals.
*MOT:	I like their markings.

*MOT:	um they're nocturnal ⌈animals⌉.
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	I think they forage, forage for food.
*MOT:	I think they eat bugs and stuff that they scrape up.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um their only defense really is you know the smell.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	makes most everything else run away from it.
*MOT:	and I guess they can bite and all that too if they're cornered but
	the smell probably makes everything get far enough away that it
	doesn't have to bite anything.
*MOT:	so that's about all I know about skunks.
*INV:	okay.
*INV:	you're doing a really great job.
*MOT:	oh, thanks.
@G:	Judge
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um, the first thing that came to mind was a judge.

*INV:	                                    ⌊right⌋.

*MOT:	um.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	um, well he's African-American.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	he kind of looks a little bit like Clarence Thomas.
*INV:	oh okay.
*MOT:	but that's only because he's a judge too and that's what I'm thinking.
*MOT:	he probably doesn't look like this picture.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	maybe a younger version of Clarence Thomas.
*INV:	oh okay.
*MOT:	uh he, wears glasses but probably just to ⌈read⌉, (be)cause he's
	taking them off.
*INV:	                                          ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
