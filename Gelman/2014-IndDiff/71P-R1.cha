@G:	Pineapple
@Types:	cross, narrative, TD
*INV:	okay so what's this?
*MOT:	it is a pineapple.
*MOT:	we are headed to Hawaii very soon.
*INV:	oh really?
*MOT:	in fact I was online looking for um, pineapple plantation tours.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so that we can you know go and see how they grow and, things like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	(be)cause you know (be)cause the kids they'll, never get a chance to see a pineapple tree unless they're in Hawaii.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	&=turns:page.
*INV:	oh, what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	oh what more can I tell you?
*MOT:	um let's see.
*MOT:	I like buying the precut pineapples without the sk-the uh the sk-the
	uh skin on them ⌈because they're prickly⌉.
*INV:	                ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and if I buy (th)em whole like this.
*MOT:	which of course they're less expensive that way.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I make my husband cut them.
*MOT:	we are [?] pineapple fans at home.
*MOT:	I told someone the other day that I want my biggest stress in Hawaii to be how much pineapple I eat and whether the acid in the pineapple gives me heart burn.
*INV:	mm,  Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I'm expecting and that's typical when you're, ⌈expecting to get
	heartburn so⌉.
*INV:	                                              ⌊oh⌋, huh.
*INV:	okay, hm.
*MOT:	everything's all smushed.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so that just kinda happens.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	anything else you want to say?
*MOT:	no.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Cracker
*INV:	then what's this?
*MOT:	a saltine.
*MOT:	or a, some similar type cracker.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	well what it makes me think of is in our family my husband likes to take the saltines and swirl them in the peanut butter jar.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	not with the knife.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	right in the jar.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and so it's become kind of a thing on our family that he makes designs in the peanut butter with the cracker.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and so if you come along and he's made a design.
*MOT:	you know with your knife to make your peanut butter sandwich or
	whatever.
*MOT:	it's like should I mess it up?
*MOT:	am I gonna get +...
*MOT:	is he gonna get upset?
*MOT:	but um he likes to eat these kind of at night kind of as a nighttime snack.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	crackers with peanut butter.
*MOT:	and it's become a big deal with Firstname and his dad.
*MOT:	he gets a single.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	or a double.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	like a sandwich.
*MOT:	so he'll run into the room and say Dad give me a single.
*MOT:	(be)cause like if his dad's sitting there and eating it or whatever.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	gimme a double.
*MOT:	so, in fact he had peanut butter and saltines at lunch today so.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	it's right in my mind.
*MOT:	he's like I just need one more so I can finish up the peanut butter.
*MOT:	(be)cause I put the peanut butter on his plate.
*MOT:	we don't let him swirl.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes] mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I'm sure it's really hygienic the way my husband does it.
*INV:	anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	it's true to life size.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	maybe a little bit bigger than a regular saltine.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	no.
*INV:	okay, okay.
@G:	Ballerina
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	a ballerina.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	en pointe.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	in a tutu.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so she must be well see her costume looks kind of practical.
*MOT:	but then the tutu makes you think maybe she's practicing for some kind of a an event or something like that.
*INV:	mm,  Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she's en pointe.
*MOT:	she doesn't have any fingers.
*INV:	&=laughs tell me more.
*MOT:	she doesn't have a nose.
*INV:	hm,  Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	kind of a, interpretive picture.
*MOT:	they they detail the strap on the on the pointe shoe.
*MOT:	and the frills on the tutu, but she doesn't have a nose.
*MOT:	I she doesn't really have much to speak of in terms of eyes.
*MOT:	and she doesn't um have fingers.
*MOT:	but she looks happy.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes], uh-huh [= filler].
*MOT:	and her body language suggests she's happy and [?] the smile.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	she's having a good time.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I have nothing else to say about the ballerina.
*INV:	okay, okay.
@G:	Skunk
*MOT:	oh boy.
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	stinky skunk.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	yes I'm, I'm prejudice against skunks.
*MOT:	you know, they're the worst when they're road kill.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	because then you drive through them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and then your car smells.
*MOT:	and everything in your car smells.
*MOT:	you can get your car washed and it still doesn't work.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	we have a big story about a skunk in our family.
*MOT:	we um had to have our condo building fumigated.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	for termites when we lived in California.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and so four families lived in the building.
*MOT:	and they had to tent the whole building.
*MOT:	I don't know if you've ever seen it ⌈but you have to um, you have to
	move out⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊mm-mm⌋ [= no].
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and you have to take all your um your plants, and you have to secure your medicines and your foods.
*MOT:	like you can't leave like open foodstuffs on the counter or whatever.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and then um you know you move out.
*MOT:	I mean it's this serious ⌈gas that they blow into this tent⌉.
*INV:	                         ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	I mean the tent, imagine you know a four, uh four condominium two
	story building ⌈covered with this big⌉.
*INV:	               ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	it was horrible.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	but there's really not a lot else.
*MOT:	you can spot treat termites but if you can't see where they are you don't know to spot treat.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and they're horribly damaging.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so um, we fumigated.
*MOT:	and when we went back in we thought we smelled a skunk and we thought that um maybe there was one out lived on the hill.
*MOT:	maybe on the hill outside our house.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and every day it just kept getting worse ⌈and worse⌉.
*INV:	                                         ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	so we're lighting.
*MOT:	you know those Glade candles?
*MOT:	not just regular candles.
*INV:	                   ⌈uh-huh⌉ [= yes].
*MOT:	like air freshener ⌊candles⌋.
*MOT:	so the combination of the skunk smell getting worse and worse.
*MOT:	in our closet it smelled the worst.
*MOT:	by our clothes.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and these aroma candles that you know didn't just kind of dissipate
	but you know ⌈the perfume hung in the air⌉?
*INV:	             ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋,  Mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	well come to find out that there was a skunk behind a little shed
	that we had on our back patio ⌈when they fumigated⌉.
*INV:	                              ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*MOT:	and it died.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so when skunks die the oil glands in their uh body continue to function.
*INV:	          ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	the scent ⌊glands⌋.
*MOT:	and um as the heat would go up outside or go down at night because
	you know it's quite cool in northern California at night.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	the heat would come up in the daytime.
*MOT:	the smell would be released.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so we finally found it.
*MOT:	and ⌈we we destroyed the the shed⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	because it was an old wood shed.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um and the skunk was removed.
*MOT:	and it took awhile for the smell in our house to dissipate.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	I mean we we tried.
*MOT:	and then I don't know if you.
*MOT:	do you have pets?
*INV:	no.
*MOT:	okay so with pets um when they get skunked you can use tomato juice or whatever.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but you can also use the mixture of peroxide water and dish soap.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	it's very foamy with the skunk smell and ⌈lifts it out⌉.
*INV:	                                         ⌊huh⌋.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and then they make it professionally but you can make it at home too.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so we literally were out even putting this mixture on the ground.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	to try and get the smell to dissipate.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	it was horrible.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	yeah.
*MOT:	that, termites and a skunk and then that particular condo we also had rats when we lived in it.
*INV:	oh, oh.
*MOT:	so we were like critter haven or something.
*INV:	ah.
*MOT:	I have, this also kinda always.
*MOT:	you know you think of Pepe_Le_Pew.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes],  mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I'm not a big Bugs_Bunny fan but Pepe was funny.
*INV:	is there anything else you can tell me?
*MOT:	you know it's interesting their resemblance to a badger through the face is interesting.
*INV:	hm.
*INV:	hm, okay.
@G:	Butterfly
*MOT:	that's a monarch.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's a nice detailed picture of the monarch.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and I guess what it makes me think of is um that place in California
	that's like Monarch City usa.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	it was not very far from where we lived.
*MOT:	where they migrate there.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	they pass through on migration so they always.
*MOT:	butterfly City usa or something.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	so they all stop there.
*MOT:	and I mean there's thousands and thousands of them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but um I always liked to look at butterflies and not touch.
*MOT:	and of course as a mother of a boy it's always a hard thing to convey to children.
*MOT:	that if you touch the butterfly you're going to damage the little teeny feathers on their wings.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes] ⌈uh-huh [= filler]⌉.
*MOT:	and then they're going to die ⌊so⌋.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	uh we just planted butterfly bushes in our yard though.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so we're hoping to attract.
*MOT:	I can't remember.
*MOT:	there's a Latin name for them.
*MOT:	a real name for them ⌈besides butterfly bushes⌉.
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	so we're hoping to attract them because they're they're so pretty to look at in your garden.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	fluttering around.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	xxx hummingbirds so.
*MOT:	um, you can certainly tell from this picture that it was a caterpillar.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's a nice, kind of detailed picture.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler], okay.
*MOT:	a little bit more representative than that ballet dancer with no mouth.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
@G:	Ice Cream
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	strawberry ice cream.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I think.
*MOT:	well it could be, you know it could be raspberry.
*MOT:	it could be sherbet.
*MOT:	on a waffle cone.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes],  mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	um, not my favorite flavor.
*MOT:	I'm a chocolate kind of girl &=whispers.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um actually Moose_Tracks.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	have you had it?
*INV:	no.
*MOT:	it's uh vanilla ice cream with little teeny peanut butter cups and swirls of like fudge in it.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	try it sometime.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	if you're a chocolate fan.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	you know since I'm pregnant course this makes me want ice cream.
*MOT:	and I don't deny myself that when I feel like I need it.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so maybe I'll go to xxx [= ice cream shop] afterwards.
*INV:	ah.
*MOT:	no probably not.
*MOT:	on to the duties of, the day.
*MOT:	um, it looks rather perfect.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	ice cream doesn't usually look that perfect for very long.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	melting ⌈or, bites taken out of it⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	or licked.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	it's so funny having you ask that.
*MOT:	like I'm sitting here going should I tell her more?
*MOT:	should I have had Firstname like explain more about the pictures?
*MOT:	should I just let him pace himself?
*MOT:	you know?
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	you're like second guessing yourself.
*MOT:	did we do it wrong?
*INV:	oh no.
*MOT:	am I doing it wrong if I flip the page?
*MOT:	no I'm flipping the page.
*INV:	&=laughs okay.
@G:	Race Car Driver
*MOT:	nascar.
*MOT:	did you know that nascar is the single biggest fan sport there is now?
*INV:	no really?
*MOT:	really.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	well because think about it.
*MOT:	at any given nascar race there's thousands of people.
*MOT:	and then um you know it's on tv.
*MOT:	and there's tons of nascar.
*MOT:	and it's not just nascar it's all the related series.
*MOT:	no Indy and nascar are different.
*MOT:	but there's all sorts of stuff related to nascar.
*MOT:	I don't even know it all ⌈(be)cause I'm not a nascar fan⌉.
*INV:	                         ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	but.
*MOT:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	always makes me think of the South.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and spitting and chewing.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and women dressed scantily.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	um, I've been to Indy and it's definitely an experience to do one time.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I mean it's fast.
*MOT:	it's loud.
*MOT:	it's intense.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it makes me think of that guy who's dad died.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	is it Dale Earnhardt ⌈and Dale Earnhardt Jr⌉?
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	I think that could be it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and you know how do you get.
*MOT:	after your dad you know dies in a racing wreck how do you get back into a car?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but I always think of beer.
*MOT:	cigarettes.
*MOT:	chewing tobacco.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	it's not like I think of it as a wholesome sport.
*MOT:	you know I know (be)cause I knew somebody who drove a racecar that it requires intense concentration.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and there's a lot of shifting going on.
*MOT:	and it gets really hot on the track and in the car.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I mean it does require skill.
*MOT:	it's not, it's not a, completely mindless, brainless, ⌈talentless
	sport⌉.
*INV:	                                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	but it really has no appeal to me whatsoever.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	can you say a little bit more?
*MOT:	you know the stands are filled.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that car looks like it's getting prepped for the race.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he looks like he's maybe getting ready to go or something.
*MOT:	because um, he looks like kind of pretty well like rested.
*MOT:	not stressed out post race or anything.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes],  mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	he's alone.
*MOT:	and all those people.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I mean the other car's surrounded by all those people but he's alone.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	okay okay.
@G:	Parrot
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	a parrot of some variety.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	with lots and lots of pretty detailed feathers.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	so a lot of these pictures for me evoke memories.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	for us my dad has an aviary here in xxx [= city name].
*MOT:	and what happens when birds come into the us is they go into
	quarantine.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and then they can go out to pet stores or wherever to be sold.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	but they go into quarantine to be sure that they're not, sick.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	or carrying, I mean now with avian flu and all that stuff I'm sure there's very strict rules.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but they used to go into this quarantine and he'd had this bird quarantine station here in xxx [= city name] excuse me.
*MOT:	and we went and we um, we saw it sometimes.
*MOT:	and it's, you know when you get a mass of birds in one spot like
	that.
*MOT:	you know parrots cockatiels cockatoos stuff like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	they're so loud.
*MOT:	the smell of course is really intense.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	because you know there's cage after cage after cage of birds.
*MOT:	but this bird looks pretty uh happy.
*MOT:	he's hanging out on a little branch.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he sorta seems to have a happy gleem in his eye.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and of course this makes me think of that pirate picture that we had in the other book.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	because Firstname likes to dress up like a pirate.
*MOT:	and so he he was so gleeful when he saw that pirate picture.
*INV:	aw.
*MOT:	I mean even this morning he's um, he comes in to the office and
	he's like I need to call Firstname.
*MOT:	firstname's our nanny.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and I'm like well she's already on her way here.
*MOT:	why do you need to call her?
*MOT:	I just need to.
*MOT:	I just need to.
*MOT:	and so turns out he wanted her she was a pirate for Halloween.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he wanted her to bring her pirate costume so he could wear his
	and she could wear hers ⌈and they could play, this afternoon while I
	have an appointment⌉.
*INV:	                        ⌊aw⌋.
*MOT:	and then I, when she got there.
*MOT:	I didn't let him call her because she really was ten minutes from being there.
*MOT:	once she got there I um listened to the two of them chat about um how she needs to bring her pirate things next time she comes.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he's like bring it tomorrow.
*MOT:	and she said no I'm not here tomorrow.
*MOT:	tomorrow is Saturday.
*MOT:	and so, the the parrot makes me think of pirates.
*MOT:	and the bird quarantine.
*INV:	okay.
*INV:	anything else you want to tell me?
*MOT:	no we're good.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Old Woman
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	um, looks like an elderly woman.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	in the funky attire that the elderly sometimes find themselves in.
*INV:	&=laughs uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	no you know she's got the necklace thing and the bracelet thing going on.
*MOT:	so she's trying to like be like the kinda, ⌈hip⌉.
*INV:	                                           ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*MOT:	but it's the color combo that's kind of interesting.
*MOT:	pink green blue.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	clearly she has a cane for some infirmity or another.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and some rather thick looking glasses.
*MOT:	but she looks like she tries to go and do.
*MOT:	I mean she's got the earring, I don't know if they're earrings.
*MOT:	but she's got the necklace thing.
*MOT:	she looks like she's kinda on the go.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	she's got you know, she's got these shoes on that you know make me think of Elvis and the Blue_Suede_Shoes.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you know (be)cause she's ready to go.
*MOT:	but also of course when you see a picture like this.
*MOT:	my grandma was in a nursing home for a number of years.
*MOT:	and she uh, she died of organic brain syndrome and had dementia and, that was very difficult.
*MOT:	so, you know she was very hip and with it.
*MOT:	she'd never have found herself in those colors.
*MOT:	no she was an incredibly.
*MOT:	she was very attractive long into her life.
*MOT:	and um very vain actually because she was a vaudeville actress.
*INV:	                      ⌈oh wow⌉.
*MOT:	and did stage and xxx ⌊movies⌋.
*MOT:	and so you know she always like tried to put herself together nicely.
*MOT:	I mean I don't know if you, have older grandparents or whatever but I mean it would take her hours to get ready.
*MOT:	to put on her makeup and to put on her clothes, ⌈just so⌉.
*INV:	                                                ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	and uh, she never had a cane.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	never.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	I mean eventually she couldn't walk.
*MOT:	she was in a wheelchair.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but when she was kind of in her heyday of her elder years.
*MOT:	you know in her seventies before she started having dementia.
*MOT:	she, you know she went and she did.
*MOT:	and she would actually probably have been a little disparaging about this woman.
*MOT:	(be)cause my grandma dyed her hair and got it styled every week.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	she looked like she was blond and.
*INV:	oh.

@G:	Firefighter
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	firefighter on a ladder using a hose.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	um, looks like a pretty serious fire going on with the smoke and the flames.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	of course mother of boys again.
*MOT:	you know my son, all he could talk about about a year ago at this time was how he was going to be a firefighter when he grew up.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and that is like a mother's nightmare.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I mean not because it's not an honorable job or anything like that.
*MOT:	just because the, potential for harm is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but anyway, so this makes me think of Firstname when he wanted to be a firefighter.
*MOT:	he has a little Jeep that he drives around outside and, it's a fire Jeep.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and he has little costumes and.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	this morning he was playing he has a instead of a dollhouse he has a firehouse.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	excuse me.
*MOT:	with the furniture to rearrange.
*MOT:	and the firetruck.
*MOT:	and the pole.
*MOT:	and the guys in their attire and their lockers.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so, you know at last summer he was like can we stop by the firehouse?
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so this makes me think of how he wanted to be a firefighter.
*MOT:	I wonder if he still wants to be a firefighter.
*INV:	hm.
*INV:	can you tell me a little bit more?
*MOT:	he looks like he's above the fire because the hose is pointing down.
*INV:	mm, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	looks like he has a mustache.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	he's clearly not going in, because he has no tanks.
*MOT:	no oxygen mask.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	in fact his attire suggests maybe that it's this picture is a little outdated.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	because um, doesn't look like kinda modern fire ⌈gear as much⌉.
*INV:	                                                ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	I mean the hat and the boots and stuff.
*MOT:	but now they all have the rebreathers.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	even in a situation like that I would be surprised that he wouldn't have a rebreather accessible.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	no communication devices either.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	no walkie talkie or.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	so maybe just a little, little outdated.
*INV:	okay, great.
@G:	Muffin
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	this looks like, a blueberry muffin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	with some kind of streusely crunchy stuff on top.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	um, well if you haven't been there the best blueberry muffins in town the best muffins in town are at xxx [= restaurant name].
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and I like their peach muffins.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	of course they're way bigger than any one person needs to eat ⌈for
	one meal but that doesn't stop me sometimes.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*MOT:	um so this makes me think of, maybe making some blueberry muffins or having some for breakfast or something like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it looks really good because it's all streusely on top.
*MOT:	and it looks like it's got a crunchy soft kinda combo goin(g) on.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	firstname and I were talking about whether it would be neat if these were scratch and sniff pages.
*INV:	oh, mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	⌊um⌋, it looks like the lo lonely muffin.
*MOT:	it has no muffin friends.
*MOT:	it's not in a basket with a napkin.
*MOT:	it's just a sole lonely muffin.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	the kind you have to eat so it's not alone anymore.

@G:	Dolphin
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	this looks like a dolphin or a porpoise of some sort.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	me being out of the +...
*MOT:	see it's funny (be)cause this is a pretty good representation of a dolphin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and the water looks kind of, like an afterthought.
*MOT:	like oh here's a nice picture of a dolphin that we want somebody to take a look at.
*MOT:	and then, and then there's the water.
*MOT:	we'll just put it in, to add color.
*MOT:	um, course this makes me think of the whole you know ongoing
	disussion of their intelligence and ⌈whether they can communicate
	and have a language⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊mm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and we were just at the Shedd_Aquarium a couple weeks ago in um,
	Chicago ⌈and um we saw their, they did an educational presentation
	with their dolphins⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and they, told us not to rely on a dolphin saving us in the wild.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	well you know there's this.
*MOT:	the way they presented it was is it fact or is it myth?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and so there was a like a contrast for each question.
*MOT:	and one of them is would a dolphin rescue you in the wild?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and they said you wouldn't want to count on it.
*INV:	hm, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	so, but they are very social creatures.
*MOT:	and they clearly do have some kind of communication.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and um, this, whole, there's a whole big controversy about dolphins and their capture.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	even if they're going to reasonable zoological parks or re for reasonable research.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you know those kind of facilities.
*MOT:	because I saw something on like Sixty_Minutes or something like that
	about you know they capture them and how many die ⌈while they're
	waiting to be shipped out to zoos⌉.
*INV:	                                                  ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	and the premium placed on their heads ⌈and, bounty⌉.
*INV:	                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	so this one seems to be free.
*MOT:	it's missing its family though because I think they're usually in schools.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Pumpkin
*INV:	      ⌈and what's this⌉?

	&=demonstrates.

*MOT:	a slingshot.
*INV:	oh, uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	that's what made me think of bungees.
*MOT:	it had a squash shooting slingshot.
*INV:	whoa.
*MOT:	and you took a big ole bucket of you know the little decorative squashes.
*MOT:	and you could use the slingshot to, ⌈shoot (th)em out in the field
	at different targets and if you hit them you got a free pumpkin or
	whatever⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊huh⌋.
*INV:	ah.
*MOT:	it was a fun, very fun pumpkin patch down in xxx [= city name].
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	but um this of course makes me think of Halloween.
*MOT:	I don't eat pumpkin pie ⌈so this would never evoke Thanksgiving for
	me because I don't like pumpkin pie⌉.
*INV:	                        ⌊mm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I like carving the pumpkins but I don't, like eating the pumpkins.

*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so they're very close in age.
*MOT:	to a giant pumpkin patch and literally came back with a pumpkin that weighed more than my child.
*MOT:	great.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but when they, when we were out the babysitter and the boys carved the pumpkin.
*MOT:	and the baby was sitting in his high chair you know like squeezing the guts and trying to figure whether he liked it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and he &=indicates:CHI got that spoon and I swear he stuck his head
	inside to scrape that thing out.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but this makes me think of fall ⌈and Halloween and all the things we
	do⌉.
*INV:	                                ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].

*MOT:	this is an African American judge.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it looks like he +...
*MOT:	the haircut and the chair lead me to believe that this is kind of an older representation.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, (be)cause the chair is that avocado green.
*INV:	mm, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and his haircut's kind of that you know late sixties like I'm one of the first African American judges ever.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	kind of shots [?].
*MOT:	it makes me think of um, that movie In the Heat_of_the_Night.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I don't know why.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	(be)cause that guy that cop I think it was kind of looks like this guy.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, but right now of course it's on my mind very strongly what's going on in the Supreme Court.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and whether Judge Alito will get confirmed.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and you know the who, you can't miss that there was a major decision this week on abortion.

*MOT:	this looks nothing like Thomas.
*MOT:	Thomas is quite a bit older.
*MOT:	but um.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	well for me it just makes me think about the justice issues that you know we're facing right now with the president and the possibility of illegal wiretapping.
*MOT:	and um, you know the Supreme Court and its possible change in terms of being a balanced court.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um you know for me it evokes the larger issues at hand ⌈rather than
	anything particular from this picture⌉.
*INV:	                                                       ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	no you know it just kind of looks like a learned judge.
*MOT:	and like I said it looks like a judge from like the early sixties or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	I mean not early sixties.
*MOT:	early seventies or something like that because of the avocado green.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
