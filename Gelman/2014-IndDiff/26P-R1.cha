*MOT:	where it's almost like little paper cuts.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	only very very irritating.

	down as you go ⌈throughout the day⌉.
*INV:	               ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	and the porta potties would be all the way on the other side of like a mile or two long field.

*MOT:	you'd have to walk through the field to go to the ⌊bathroom⌋.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	it was a horrible experience.
*MOT:	so I had a aversion, to corn for a little bit.
*MOT:	but I got over it.

*MOT:	um, the we used to have a strawberry patch where I used to live
	where you could go and pick ⌊strawberries⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they would weigh you when you went in.
*INV:	  ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	and then you'd go to the fields and pick as many strawberries as you
	⌊want⌋.
*MOT:	and then they'd weigh you when you came out to make sure you hadn't eaten a whole bunch (be)cause then they'd charge you.
*INV:	oh no.
*MOT:	yeah it was hilarious.
*INV:	&=laughs ⌈oh⌉.

*MOT:	and one of the things I enjoyed was going over there and picking berries from their gardens.
*MOT:	we also used to have a wild strawberry patch.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	by where I lived.
*MOT:	and wild strawberries are a lot better than, ⌈homegrown
	strawberries⌉.

*MOT:	every ⌊year⌋.
*MOT:	and he used to love that.
*INV:	⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	⌊so⌋ good memories ⌈with strawberries⌉.
*INV:	                   ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
@G:	Weightlifter
*INV:	great what is this?
*MOT:	a very corny picture of a, man &=laughs, a body builder.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um again this looks like something from like Word where they'd have
	the little, ⌈pictures⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	um, or something from like Popeye.
*INV:	                                         ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you know like a big strong guy that, you ⌊know⌋.
*MOT:	he's very happy about being strong.
*MOT:	he looks like he's taking steroids.
*MOT:	&=sighs.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um steroids are bad for you.
*MOT:	they have lots and lots of bad effects.
*MOT:	that he'll probably regret when he tries to have children when he's older.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but um, &=laughs the weights are really big.
*INV:	mm-⌈hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	they don't usually make weights with the big balls ⌊anymore⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	they're usually big ring, ⌈flat discs⌉.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	anything else you'd like to tell me?
*MOT:	his legs are probably not large enough to hold up his upper torso.
*MOT:	so he'd probably collapse if he tried to move.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but that's about it.
*INV:	alright, great.
@G:	Frog
*MOT:	        ⌈and this⌉.

*MOT:	so, they're fun.
*MOT:	except when they pee on you.
*MOT:	then it's &=shakes:head.
*MOT:	but they feel really cool.
*MOT:	and actually when I was detassling we used to get the little, little
	frogs, that ⌈would go in the corn⌉.
*INV:	oh          ⌊wow⌋.
*INV:	mm-⌈hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and they were just real ⌊small⌋.

*INV:	                                     ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	and then when it gets upset it opens ⌊up⌋.

*MOT:	it's a defense mechanism to make people, make things scared of it.
*INV:	        ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	make it ⌊bigger⌋.
*MOT:	it's like birds puffing up their feathers.
*MOT:	make it look bigger than it is.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and probably this here is to look like eyes.
*INV:	                                         ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	to like that's [?] big animal staring at ⌊them⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	could even be like an owl or something that they're trying to imitate.
*MOT:	to scare other creatures off.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	big birds or something you know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and that's all <for-yeah> [?].

*MOT:	uh, ever since I was little I always thought it smelled rotten and tasted rotten.
*INV:	&=nods:yes.
*MOT:	and, I even now have trouble telling when it as has actually gone bad.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	(be)cause it's so close to the way it always smells to me.
*INV:	                                          ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	I mean when it really goes bad I know xxx ⌊know⌋.
*INV:	                                                  ⌈uh-huh [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so I always have to look for like the floaties on ⌊top⌋.
*MOT:	like when it gets a film.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and then I toss it out or look at the date.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	um I'm actually now lactose intolerant.
*MOT:	which seems kind of a coincidence since I've always hated it.
*MOT:	all my life.
*MOT:	my grandma's actually lactose intolerant too.
*MOT:	and she had the same aversion to milk ⌈as I did⌉.
*INV:	                                      ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	but she'd had it because she grew up on a farm.

*MOT:	and that nasty you know, ⌈dirty cow smell⌉.
*INV:	                         ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and, she said she never liked milk and ⌈now she's allergic⌉.
*INV:	                                       ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	or not allergic lactose intolerant.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	milk allergy is completely different from lactose intolerance.
*INV:	  ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	(be)cause in [?] milk allergy you actually can have, anaphylactic
	⌊shock⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	um, uh lactose intolerant it's just that you don't have the lactase enzyme.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so your body can't break down sugar and lactose.
*MOT:	so then the bacteria in your intestines do it.
*MOT:	and it leads to a rather, uncomfortable situation.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so I try to avoid that.
*MOT:	I use lactaid milk.
*MOT:	and I have little lactaid, ⌈caplets⌉.
*INV:	                           ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	hm what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um, not supposed to give babies under one year old milk.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	because it can cause GI bleeds.
*MOT:	um, so any milk products at all.
*MOT:	that's why they give them like formula instead of milk.
*MOT:	even though a lot of people refer to formula as milk.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	it's just not something you wanna confuse.
*MOT:	um, a lot of kids start at one year, with their, drinking their milk.
*MOT:	my or my best friend's baby is lactose intolerant.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and my daughter was too when she was first born.
*MOT:	she's not now.
*MOT:	and she had to have soy milk and ⌈so does he⌉.
*INV:	                                 ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	but his was really bad.

*MOT:	and he's very small too because he couldn't, digest ⌊it⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause a lot of the times anything that you digest with lactose would just come right out.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].

*INV:	                                    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	they're supposed to have like six I ⌊think⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so like three of them ended up dying (be)cause they were too small.
*INV:	                                         ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.

*MOT:	and then like the baby hutch.
*INV:	                                        ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and the baby hutch was just filled with ⌊babies⌋.
*INV:	                                                   ⌈uh-huh [= yes]⌉.
