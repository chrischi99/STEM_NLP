*MOT:	I think it's a very expensive meat.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I think it looks beautiful.
*MOT:	it just looks so heavy this part to ⌈proportion to the body⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊hm⌋.

*MOT:	so, it it you ⌊know⌋ it just struck me the color is so vivid.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I think is one of the things that I was thinking.
*MOT:	and yeah it's uh so big they just move xxx very.
*MOT:	um I think they are very can be very sharp.
*INV:	        ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	they uh ⌊when [?]⌋, if they grab something I think it's got to let it
	go I think xxx really.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	uh maybe for survival you know ⌈they use it in this uh⌉, cause it
	seems kinda small in the body so maybe they have a very good, ⌈um⌉,
	to survive you know.
*INV:	                               ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊hm⌋.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	<I don't know if it> [?] has something else there or not.
*MOT:	but um, it doesn't look like very appealing to me here because it looks more like uh some kind of mix of a brown spice with orange and black a little bit.
*MOT:	so I'm not sure that it's uh, ⌈um⌉, that it's still good.
*INV:	                              ⌊hm⌋.
