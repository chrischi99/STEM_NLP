*INV:	            ⌈mm-hm⌉.
*MOT:	there's his ⌊eyes⌋.
*MOT:	and his webbed feet.
*MOT:	and they start out as tadpoles and progress to being, frogs.
*MOT:	and I had to dissect one when I was in junior high.
*INV:	           ⌈oh⌉.

*MOT:	ech [= disgusted sound].
*MOT:	I hate that.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?

	c- coloring on her little board uh that we got Firstname that he
	never was very interested in.
*INV:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	so it's no wonder (be)cause they advertise it actually with a little
	girl in mind to ⌈play on the coloring board⌉.
*INV:	                ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	         ⌈mm-hm⌉.

*INV:	uh                         ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	uh the little board and it plays music and games and stuff as you're
	coloring.
*MOT:	and we were doing that today so I have the songs going through my
	head.
*MOT:	so she likes that.
*MOT:	she likes that a lot.
*MOT:	and actually Firstname's starting to like it too.
*MOT:	um, but she's taking to it earlier than he did.
*INV:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	he's not a big one for coloring.
*MOT:	but he's star- he's- it's growing on him.
*MOT:	it's he's getting there with it.
@G:	Snake
*MOT:	it's a little too sedentary for him, coloring.
*MOT:	but she likes sedentary things.
*INV:	mm-hm [?].
*INV:	okay anything else you wanna tell me?
*MOT:	no I think that's it.
*INV:	alright.
*MOT:	        ⌈and then⌉.
*INV:	what is ⌊this⌋?
*MOT:	and then this is a cobra, ⌈snake⌉.
*INV:	uh                        ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and um, my husband and I had a discussion about snakes recently.
*MOT:	and, what did he say?
*MOT:	it was from the Bible.
*INV:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	and little Firstname was there too so he would be like, “women, fear
	snakes”.
*MOT:	and he got it actually- fear- (be)cause that that bugged me when he
	said that.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um, (be)cause I'm like h- it- he sounded like he was paraphrasing it.
*INV:	⌈right⌉.
*MOT:	⌊so⌋ we had this whole discussion about snakes and women and stuff
	and, men and beginning of t- ya know, th- the Bible ⌈Genesis and
	all that stuff so⌉.
*INV:	                                                    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	so he uh, he s- he got that from one of the kids' videos, that is a
	Bible video- ⌈beginners' Bibles⌉.
*INV:	uh           ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and it- they did say that people fear snakes not women fear snakes.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and actually that women- what's the other word for strongly dislike?
*MOT:	whatever the word is for strongly dislike.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm⌉.
*MOT:	⌊we⌋ looked it up in the thesaurus ⌈and it's not fear it's strongly
	dislike⌉.
*INV:	uh                                 ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	so we had this whole big discussion ⌈about⌉, ya know women fearing
	snakes.
*INV:	uh                                  ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and I was like well it's only common sense you don't wanna be near a
	snake.
*MOT:	it might bite you and then you die.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	so, so there's this whole thing about snakes with us recently.
*MOT:	but that one definitely if it bit you ⌈you would die⌉.
*INV:	                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so, ⌈that's what I would teach my children⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	to stay away from.
*INV:	                                               ⌈mm-hm⌉.
*MOT:	and he's like “well I had snakes when I was a little kid and we
	collected (th)em in some kind of aquarium or ⌊something”⌋.
*MOT:	and I'm like well your mom must not have feared snakes
	then.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	if you had, snakes in an aquarium I think in your house, she must
	not have feared snakes ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	mm-hm go ahead and say just a little bit ⌊more⌋.
*MOT:	well I would describe that they're long and.
*MOT:	well I mean not [?] everybody knows a cobra's gonna like unlatch
	their jaws ⌈and swallow complete animals and stuff like that⌉.
*INV:	uh         ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	I mean who would want to be near something like that?
*MOT:	they digest you and you're gone ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	                                ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	oh and the the the snake and Satan and all that, ⌈ya know⌉.
*INV:	                                                 ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so, they- that would be ya know we- this S- Satan being, uh, pun- or
	his curse was to forever, ya know travel on his belly ⌈and
	everything⌉.
*INV:	                                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	because of Adam and Eve an- and Eve Ad- Eve eating from the fruit
	she wasn't supposed to on the tree and.
*MOT:	so we went into all that.
*MOT:	and so little Firstname, actually it was pretty interesting because
	he went upstai- or no we had the tapes downstairs.
*MOT:	we had (th)em upstairs for awhile.
*INV:	                                            ⌈mm-hm⌉.
*MOT:	and he got out his- he he knew which one to ⌊get⌋.
*MOT:	so he got out his Creation Be- ⌈Beginner Bible video and wanted to
	watch it⌉.
*INV:	                               ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	⌊after⌋ we're like looking in the Bible ⌈about a couple different
	things⌉, trying to of course have to argue,  &=laughs over something
	very very trivial it seemed like to me.
*INV:	uh                                      ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	   ⌈but oh well at least it got little Firstname thinking⌉.
*INV:	uh ⌊huh⌋.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	so he wanted to watch his video.
*MOT:	and that's when Daddy realized he got the word fear instead of
	strongly dislike.
*INV:	            ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	so this whole you know, discussion over nitty gritty, you know
	splitting ⌊hairs⌋.
*MOT:	but no the the s- the snake always is like you know it's a symbol
	of, uh, s.
*MOT:	but the the strange thing is is that in the Bible they have the
	snake that um Moses ⌈and the s- uh⌉, he [?] pick it up and it turns
	into a, turns into a staff.
*INV:	                    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	you know and and physicians and snakes and the staff and the healer
	⌈the symbol⌉.
*INV:	⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	it's weird how it can mean bad things and good things at the same
	time.
@G:	Weightlifter
*INV:	h huh.
*MOT:	ya know?
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	so, so yeah it's complicated.
*MOT:	snakes can be kinda complicated I suppose.
*MOT:	there's our whole long nitty gritty discussion about snakes.
*INV:	okay great.
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a body builder.
*MOT:	with his weights.
*INV:	        ⌈mm-hm⌉.

*MOT:	something you'd see on on the cartoon ⌊shows⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	um, well, just that u- usually body builders are a lot into
	themselves and their looks and things.
*MOT:	which is fine.
*INV:	               ⌈mm-hm⌉.
*MOT:	you need to do ⌊that⌋.
*MOT:	but you also need to balance in your life.
*MOT:	and sometimes people that focus on you know like if it's
	proportionately this much more muscle and stuff like that they
	usually focus more on, inward than, ⌈the whole picture of life and
	stuff like that⌉ ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	                 ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	which is fine.
*MOT:	but uh you know there needs to be a balance for everybody in in life.
*MOT:	but, you know it's what people like to do.
*MOT:	and if that's their hobby and that's their thing that makes (th)em
	happy go- more power to ya.
*MOT:	if it makes you happy and you're enjoying your life because you're
	doin(g) it, and.

*MOT:	it's definitely healthier.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	for you to be fit and everything like that.
*MOT:	um, so he obviously, from the from the little sketch lifts a lot of
	weight ⌈and stuff like that and is strong⌉.
*INV:	       ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so, but I mean with a smile of course you think of being like, “look
	at me look at me I'm so good lookin'” type of thing or something
	like that ⌈ya know⌉?
*INV:	uh huh, uh ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	so vain it comes to mind ⌈I s(up)pose with the smirk⌉.
*INV:	                         ⌊right⌋.
*INV:	&=laughs yeah.
*MOT:	so oh well.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	but if it makes him happy more power to ya.
*MOT:	(be)cause you know I've met people that are actually body builders.
*INV:	⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	⌊and⌋ they're nice people ⌈ya know⌉?
*INV:	                          ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	everybody's gotta have their thing.
*INV:	                                      ⌈mm-hm⌉.

*MOT:	but I mean they look like they're concentrating.

*MOT:	so I s(up)pose, ⌈that might be a reason why people think they're
	wise⌉.
*INV:	                ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	I don't know a whole lot about owls.

*MOT:	that's kinda funny.
*MOT:	but then that line it's- it looks like a cross.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and uh- looks like a heart surge- nearly like a heart surgery
	incision.
*MOT:	a little low.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	so he's surfing though.

	better”.
*MOT:	“gotta do things I never thought I'd do before but wanted to do”.
*INV:	&=laughs right.
*MOT:	so he's happy.

*MOT:	so he's daring.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	for a guy.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	that's not a child wearing those.

	something instead of swim trunks I s(up)pose.
*INV:	                               ⌈uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	not that I'm making fun of him ⌊but⌋.

*MOT:	and uh, not like the body builder though ya know?
*MOT:	so he's, tryin(g) to, keep some, keep some balance in his life where
	he does have something fun and active to do but not just focus on
	           ⌈himself I s(up)pose⌉.
*INV:	uh huh, uh ⌊huh⌋.

*MOT:	we've got Lion King Lion King, ⌊II⌋.

*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	or some of (th)em at least, ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	uh                          ⌊huh⌋.

*MOT:	and um, so yeah king of the jungle.
*MOT:	very, strong animal.
*INV:	                        ⌈mm-hm⌉.
*MOT:	that takes on, all the other animals and keeps his place in,
	society in his jungle ⌊society⌋.
*MOT:	so uh, so he's more like a leader type.
*INV:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	and, oh nobody really wants to mess with him because he's he's the
	boss &=laughs.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	so.
*INV:	okay anything else you wanna say?
*MOT:	um, well in like a lion out like a lamb.
*INV:	              ⌈uh huh⌉.
*MOT:	reminds me of ⌊springtime⌋.
*MOT:	yep, and since we were talking about other Biblical stuff course
	lions come up t-come in mind for, um, how it's- there's there's
	references to the lion in the Bible ⌈and stuff like that⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	with the, I think it's xxx times lion laying down with the lamb.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	so, which wouldn't happen.
*MOT:	a lion would, eat a lamb &=laughs.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	(be)cause the lamb's the opposite of a lion.
*MOT:	a l- lamb is very passive and the lion's very aggressive and.
*MOT:	they would be like “oh I get I get to have some lambchops for l- for
	lunch”.
*MOT:	so, &=laughs so that brings that to mind.
*INV:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	and uh, yep.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	well that- and it's uh- the the lion and cats are related so.
*INV:	                                       ⌈uh huh⌉.

*MOT:	and that- we'll ⌈we'll be going to the zoo so I'm sure I'll see a
	lion at the zoo too⌉.
*INV:	                ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and it's a male lion too because the males, like with other animals
	and, ducks in the other book that I was Firstname was just looking
	at ⌈a mallard duck is always the prettier of the two⌉ ⌈sexes⌉.
*INV:	   ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	uh                                                    ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	and the male lion with all this hair and everything, ⌈um⌉, is more
	attractive or catches your eyes more ya know?
*INV:	                                                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	and uh, so, maybe that's what body builders- they're more like
	primals &=laughs.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	and they try to look xxx &=laughs.
*MOT:	y- you know what I mean?
*MOT:	like ⌈body builders are like “I'm too sexy for my shirt” &=laughs⌉.

*MOT:	and then um, so, so they're part lion or something ⌈or
	some(thi)n(g)⌉.
*INV:	uh                                                 ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	but no um, but the the- also the only last thing would be the lion
	reminds me of the lion from Wizard of Oz.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm⌉.
*MOT:	⌊people⌋ probably say a lot (be)cause this one actually looks a lot
	like ⌈the lion from Wizard of Oz⌉.
*INV:	     ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	and and he ends up getting his courage or whatever.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	so, ⌈so that's a cute⌉, that's a very nice movie too.
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
