@Types:	cross, narrative, TD
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a clown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	I don't know why he's plugging his ears.
*MOT:	like something's gonna explode.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	it does remind me that I need to get back home to do work on his birthday party for tomorrow.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	the nightmare that is.
*MOT:	so I'm just praying for no rain tomorrow.
*INV:	mm hm.
*MOT:	planning hopefully to have a good time.
*MOT:	and no rain so I don't have to entertain all these preschoolers
	inside my house instead of outside in the yard.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*INV:	can you say a little bit more?
*MOT:	that's about it.
*MOT:	I don't you know you [?] don't seeing a lot of clowns.
*MOT:	I've only taken him to the circus once.
*MOT:	when it came to Ypsi when it was um ⌈up at Eastern's campus⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and he was real real little so, I don't even think he liked the animals.
*MOT:	but other than that, clowns.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Alligator
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that is either an alligator or a crocodile but as with the frog and toad in the book I went through with him I don't know the difference myself.
*INV:	oh that's alright.
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	again they remind me of you know Florida.
*MOT:	the southern state.
*MOT:	one time I went with my friend Firstname ⌈and her husband and his
	son⌉.
*INV:	                                         ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and um had alligator as an appetizer.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	yeah in a restaurant ⌈down there⌉.
*INV:	                     ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	it wasn't bad.
*MOT:	you know it was not something that you know would be like mmm like lobster or something but it was alright.
*MOT:	um, xxx.
*MOT:	and I can never remember if there's a difference between one or the
	other of (th)em that they would what is it that they say that you
	could hold their mouth shut with one hand.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	that their jaws are really strong this way but not so the other way.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so if you were you know around one that you cou you could actually with one hand hold its mouth shut.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	but again I don't know if that's alligators or crocodiles and I
	can't tell the difference.
*MOT:	so um, I guess that's about it.
*MOT:	                         ⌈I was unaware that they had webbed feet <like that> [?]⌉.
*INV:	can you tell me anything ⌊else⌋?

*MOT:	I was a fan of the Crocodile_Hunter show for awhile.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	we used to watch it a lot but.

*MOT:	um I guess that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Witch
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a witch.

*MOT:	I was like doesn't aren't you afraid of them?
*MOT:	and he was like what the monkeybirds?
*MOT:	no I'm not afraid of those.
*MOT:	and I was like cracking up I'd never heard anybody call (th)em a monkeybird either though.
*MOT:	but that's a good description you know.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	and I said oh well good then.
*MOT:	you're a big boy then not to be afraid.
*MOT:	he he goes I'm not afraid of that witch either.
*MOT:	and I said okay well good for you because when I was your age I was terrified of her.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but that's what.
*MOT:	I mean it's sorta funny though.
*MOT:	because it like has that evil witch kinda cartoon but she has a smile on her face.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so you know that's, that's not scary.
*INV:	can you tell me more?
*MOT:	my step daughter was a witch for Halloween ⌈not last year but the
	year before⌉.
*INV:	                                           ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	then wanted to again last year and we were be somethin(g) else you know.
*MOT:	you were a year before.
*MOT:	but um, that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	I understand Bewitched is coming out in the movie.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and I can't stand Nicole Kidman so I wouldn't want to probably go.
*MOT:	I don't go to.
*MOT:	I hate going to the movies but.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I wait for everything to come out on video but.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	I liked that show as a kid.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
@G:	Penguin
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a penguin.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, okay.
*MOT:	I work for a delivery service.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	um and I don't know what the odds are that anyone who works with me would never see this tape but um.
*MOT:	somehow someway it's one of the managers I work with is always drawing cartoons and stuff and he adopted this cartoon of a penguin that he started putting all over everything and making it like part of our logo with this penguin.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and I was like.
*MOT:	and I always I just shut my mouth for a long time.
*MOT:	but I was like it just doesn't make any sense.
*MOT:	<delivery service> [?] you know I mean.
*MOT:	penguins aren't even that fast.
*MOT:	well I guess in water.
*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	they can swim pretty quickly.
*MOT:	but it doesn't even make sense.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it's stupid.
*MOT:	and so I had a number of drivers who actually would complain xxx puttin(g) that penguin on the truck.
*MOT:	and I was like yeah they are.
*INV:	⌈oh wow⌉.
*MOT:	⌊thankfully⌋ we are now moving away from the penguin ⌈and into you
	know I don't know what⌉.
*INV:	oh                                                   ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	but his name was Firstname and I think his website was just horrible but.
*INV:	oh my.
*MOT:	and so that's what I always think of first now ⌈when I think of
	penguins⌉.
*INV:	                                               ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	but um, when I was in high school my best friend who's still my best friend today.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	um, her name in high school she's married now but her name was
	Firstname.
*MOT:	so it always you know.
*MOT:	so we started calling her penguin I think somewhere in about the tenth grade.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and it stuck almost about (un)til she got married I think ⌈and
	changed her last name but⌉.
*INV:	oh                                                        ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	but it always reminds me of that too.
*INV:	oh.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	uh the zoo.
*MOT:	I love the zoo.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	you know I love I do like to go see the penguins at the zoo.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	they are kinda cool when you seem (th)em get in and swim and you know like that.
*MOT:	but, and um one of the few birds I know that can't actually fly.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	that's about all I know about penguins.
*INV:	great.
@G:	Teacher
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that's a teacher.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and this particularly appears to be a geometry teacher.
*MOT:	my geometry teacher was a man.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	um, not a woman.
*MOT:	but um I'm starting to feel like there's a theme sort of here in these books.
*MOT:	he was having trouble with you know the the the girl farmer.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	figuring that out.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	he did the second time he looked at it that it was a farmer.
*MOT:	the first time he said she was a nurse so.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	um, but really um and I  you know know that women aren't really known as much as men for their mathematical skills.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	however, um aside from geometry the rest of my math teachers in high school were female.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	my algebra teacher was female.
*MOT:	the trigonometry teacher was female.
*MOT:	and the calculus teacher was female.
*MOT:	so, so so much for that right?
*MOT:	but I did like geometry a lot.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and excelled in that class.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	                                                             ⌈tell me more⌉.
*MOT:	it's one that uh one of the you know I didn't like math that ⌊much⌋.
*MOT:	but um it was the one that I actually you know it clicked for me.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I got it so so I liked it because it was easy for me in that sense.
*MOT:	but I don't remember a whole lot of it.
*MOT:	but, it was a long time ago.
*MOT:	um, ⌈I would have xxx comments for whoever dressed her⌉.
*INV:	anything else you'd like to tell ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	odd choices there.
*MOT:	but you know that's about it.
*MOT:	other than that that and chalk chalk xxx.
*MOT:	god I hate the feeling of chalk.
*MOT:	I bought him and I don't know where my head was.
*MOT:	I bought him a chalkboard table.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	last Christmas and &=makes:whistling_noise.
*MOT:	I can't even someone else has to go clean it and pick up after it because I can't stand the feeling of chalk.
*INV:	oh really?
*MOT:	it's like it's the same it's the same as the feeling of velvet.
*MOT:	I can't stand that either.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	it just gives me the willies ⌈to touch it⌉.
*INV:	                             ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and chalk's the same way.
*MOT:	xxx that.
*INV:	hm.
@G:	Horse
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	<it um> [?] a horse.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	a baby horse.
*MOT:	I can't remember what those are called.
*INV:	that's alright.
*MOT:	but uh um, I don't know much about horses.
*MOT:	I don't care that much for horses to tell you the truth.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	I've never done real good in horseback riding.
*MOT:	I think twice in my life.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and both times were just well you know, trust me.
*MOT:	it knows who's in charge.
*MOT:	it knows it's not me you know?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	there's no convincing it of that you know.
*MOT:	it outweighs me about fourteen hundred pounds.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I think it knows it.
*MOT:	you know that kinda thing but um.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	I do like um, have had some pretty good times at Northville Downs though however.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	betting on the horse race.
*MOT:	&=laughs I don't like horses but I like to gamble so, we've had some fun there for sure.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	um, but, he did tell me that they had a horse at um some petting zoo that comes to your preschool.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	some like traveling petting zoo.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and that's what they did as a fundraiser kinda thing ⌈it was like
	five bucks a kid or something⌉.
*INV:	oh,                                                  ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and the petting zoo came and they got I asked him and he said yeah I saw a pig and a horse and a, rabbit.
*MOT:	and they sent home a picture of him holding a rabbit and stuff like that but.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	I guess that's.
*MOT:	and my friend Firstname now, her parents have horses.
*MOT:	and that was a cool thing for our kids.
*MOT:	you know?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	every year they have a reunion at her house and her dad will get the saddle the horses up and take the kids around and stuff like that on (th)em so.
*MOT:	so that's cool that he gets to have the experience of things that I
	normally wouldn't even ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	                       ⌊right⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	that he gets to have it anyway because other people in his life do it.
*MOT:	all kinda of things xxx for me but.
*MOT:	um I guess that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Popcorn
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	popcorn.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and that's one of his sort of favorite snacks.
*MOT:	so we always have popcorn at our house.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	but I it's one of those things for me that I like for about the
	first three or four bites maybe ⌈and then it's like &=makes:face⌉.
*INV:	                                ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	which is odd for me because I'm like a big fan of salt.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	but, um, and popcorn sort of always goes together with the movies for ya.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	you know and that's that is another thing that I although I said I
	hate going to the movies and I never go to the movies ⌈and I always
	wait for everything to come out on video that as a parent and the
	sacrifice that I make for him⌉.
*INV:	                                                      ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so I would say in the last five years since his birth the only
	movies that I've seen in the theater were made by Disney.
*MOT:	but I do take him and ⌈and um go⌉.
*INV:	                      ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and we you know we saw that and Wild_Thornberry's.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	we went and saw in the theater.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um he he loves to go to the movies.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	in the theater.
*MOT:	and it was the most hysterical thing.
*MOT:	I took him to see Ice_Age and I don't know if you've ever seen it.
*MOT:	but at the very beginning there's this avalanche scene.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and we were sitting real close and he was just like &=freezes.
*INV:	oh &=laughs.
*MOT:	and I was like It's okay honey.
*MOT:	it's not really.
*MOT:	and he's just gripping my arm.
*MOT:	I was like it's not really gonna get ya you know.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so oh boy.
*MOT:	that's what popcorn always makes me think of.
*MOT:	the movies.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*INV:	                              ⌈what else can you⌉?
*MOT:	when I was a kid my uncle used to always take us to the drive in and
	I thought that was a lot of ⌊fun⌋.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	put up like the back he'd back in and take make the whole bed of his truck with blankets and pillows and stuff.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and put the speakers right there and go there's a bunch of crap and you know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and you got to stay up extra late because of drive in movies didn't start (un)til it was dark and I haven't even seen a drive in in ages.
*MOT:	that it was a fun thing.
*MOT:	I miss that.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	I think that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	I would like to have some glass mixing bowls.
@G:	Cereal
*INV:	alright, what is this?
*MOT:	cereal.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	exactly the way I would eat cereal.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	because I'm allergic to milk.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	um, that's how my cereal always looked as a child.
*MOT:	actually no.
*MOT:	I had soy milk as a child.
*MOT:	but um, there was a few times my mom mixed up mine and my sister's bowl of cereal you know.
*MOT:	we'd both take one bite and go &=makes:face ew wrong one &=laughs.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	but uh it in particular it appears to be cornflakes.
*MOT:	which always a favorite of mine you know.
*MOT:	I like Frosted_Flakes a lot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but we never were as children allowed to have any sugared cereals.
*MOT:	you know all no none at all.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so it was a big deal for me to you know actually like to have.
*MOT:	I think the first thing you know.
*MOT:	my younger sister the first thing she did when she got her driver's
	license was drive to the store and buy a box of Fruit_Loops.
*MOT:	but I let him, usually I pick one good for you kind of cereal and he picks one whatever kind of cereal.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and he has to have the good cereal for breakfast but is allowed to have the other kind as snack or whatever.
*INV:	oh, uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	he can have his second bowl be that if he eats his first bowl and wants a second bowl he can have the sugary stuff but.
*INV:	oh.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	I always figured I guess you know with that type of cereal I always added my own sugar anyway.
*MOT:	and what I added probably resulted in way more than they were putting on that other kind anyway.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but um, that's about it.
*MOT:	I don't even eat a whole lot of cereal.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but uh we have three kids.
*MOT:	so we usually we manage to go through a box before it gets stale.
*MOT:	where as previously I would buy a box of cereal before I had
	children ⌈and throw three quarters of it away so⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊right⌋.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Pilot
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	it appears to be a pilot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	looking out the front of his door xxx.
*MOT:	what is that supposed to be?
*MOT:	the door of the cockpit or something?
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	um, I've like flown my whole life.
*MOT:	when we were kids my mom flew us back and forth to Maine.
*MOT:	that's where she was from originally.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and most of her family lived so um it was never, you know what I mean.
*MOT:	I know for a lot of people it's like it seems like a huge deal.
*MOT:	I guess it's what you become accustomed to even from when, you know.
*MOT:	and it was always just what we did.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and then I would say when I was in my early twenties I went um flew to Las Vegas with a girl that I worked with.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	and she we were the same age you know but it was the first time she had ever been on an airplane and it was so cool.
*MOT:	and I was like that's so funny.
*MOT:	you're a grown up and you've never flown before you know?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and so they made this big deal out of it.
*MOT:	and we you know I told them that.
*MOT:	(be)cause at first they tried to seat us separately.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and I said you know she's never flown before.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	can you find somebody who might be willing to trade with us ⌈so that
	we can sit together⌉?
*INV:	                                                            ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and they were like really?
*MOT:	that is so cool.
*MOT:	so then when when we landed they invited her up into the cockpit.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	and the pilot let her sit in his seat.
*MOT:	put his hat on.
*MOT:	and they look pictures and gave her the little wings and all of that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it was it was cool.
*INV:	oh wow.
*MOT:	um, ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	what more can you tell ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	he's flown probably um.
*MOT:	we we flew to um Antigua and back.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	so that was a, that was a long flight.
*MOT:	with a child.
*MOT:	I flew to Maine and back with him.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	um myself.
*MOT:	but the next time I think you know uh the time after that I drove.
*MOT:	um and I had a VCR and stuff in my mom's minivan.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it was just me and him so it was easier.
*MOT:	but in the one to Antigua I mean it was just one of those situations where I intentionally kept him up before our flight hoping that he would sleep.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and then they delayed the flight by like an hour and a half.
*MOT:	and it was so hot in there like you couldn't even barely breathe.
*MOT:	and so he was uncomfortable.
*MOT:	and until they you couldn't turn any air on until they until-for some reason until the plane was in the air.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and it was just horrible.
*MOT:	and then at that point he was overtired and wouldn't sleep.
*MOT:	and he just screamed and cried and screamed.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	it was like one of those nightmare things.
*MOT:	where you're just thinking oh my god, I love you so much but there's
	like two hundred and fifty people here that want me to smack the
	crap out of you right now.
*MOT:	you've got to stop screaming.
*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	so um that's kinda that experience but.
*INV:	anything else you want to tell me?
*MOT:	um, that's about it I think.
*MOT:	I'm gonna get married in August.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I guess um one of my fiancée's closest friend's wife is a pilot.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	which still amazes me to this day because I've only met him like twice and I'm like he's practically brain dead.
*MOT:	really his wife is a pilot?
*MOT:	is that are you sure about that?
*MOT:	and he's like yeah.
*MOT:	I'm like okay.
*MOT:	to each there own I suppose but.

*INV:	                                                           ⌊oh⌋.

*MOT:	mm, that's about it.

*MOT:	before that they were always providing it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so it's like okay, I guess we'll have to start buying these things to send with you now because I don't know what we're gonna do.

	box⌉.
*INV:	                                              ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].

*INV:	                                         ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.

*MOT:	oddly as a grownup my fiancée is the same way now.
*MOT:	he loves lobster but he only wants me to serve him the tail because
	he doesn't want to look at his face.
*MOT:	and this is from a man who goes and shoot a deer and then just you know cut it from there to there without thinking twice.
*MOT:	but he doesn't want to look at a lobster face when he eats it.
*MOT:	but, who can say you know?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um Firstname also very much likes to when we go to the grocery store he always want to go like I'll be right back mom.

*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*MOT:	he was teeny when he was born.
*MOT:	and I said well I do have a lot of trouble.
*MOT:	and you know his doctor seems to always come to his rescue.
*MOT:	(be)cause I said I have a lot of trouble getting him to eat vegetables.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and he said I'm not real concerned about that right now so.
*MOT:	as long as he's getting all the protein he needs ⌈and all the iron
	he needs that's what I'm worried about⌉.
*INV:	                                                 ⌊right⌋.
*INV:	mm.

*MOT:	so.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	but I do like broccoli.
*MOT:	I.
*MOT:	there aren't many vegetables that I don't prefer raw to cooked.

*INV:	                                ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	if you cook it I wanna have it like covered in cheese or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but, and um, I remember as a kid calling it baby trees.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and uh brussel sprouts were baby lettuces.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and xxx baby something but.
*INV:	hm.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	I just always have always have had to.
*MOT:	when I was a kid we were allowed to not like two things and everything else we had to eat so.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	otherwise you know.
*MOT:	liver was one of my things and eggs was the other.
*MOT:	so, I always had to eat my broccoli.
*MOT:	except for the few times my sister and I if we.
*MOT:	the only thing for some reason she didn't make us eat was if we had mashed potatoes for dinner.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	she didn't force us to eat those.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	for some reason everybody got that as a freebie.
*MOT:	so my older sister and I started if there was something else on our
	plate that we didn't like we would eat most of our mashed potatoes
	and then sort of cover up the something else with the leftover
	mashed potatoes so that it looked like it was all mashed potato ⌈and
	we could get away with not eating something else⌉.
*INV:	                                                                ⌊uh-huh [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	the tricks of the childhood trade I guess.
*MOT:	and that's what later in life I was tellin(g) my mom I was like you know our mashed potato landfills that we created on our plates so that you didn't.
*MOT:	she's like that was one thing I.
*MOT:	you know usually when you grow up you start to tell your parents
	stuff ⌈and they go yeah well⌉, we knew that.
*INV:	      ⌊right⌋.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	well that was the one thing that she was like really?
*MOT:	that I didn't know.

	football teams⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	I don't know if there's anything it's not as obviously as big as the WNBA or anything.
*INV:	right.

*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and she was like a high school student who wanted to play quarterback on her high school football team.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and all the battles that she went though to get on a team.
*INV:	mm-hm.
*MOT:	and she got on a team.
*MOT:	and then ultimately was voted Homecoming_Queen.
*MOT:	so in the middle of the Homecoming game she had to go into the locker room and change into a dress which is actually really far fetched really if you think about it.
*MOT:	but that's what it reminded me of.
*MOT:	that movie.
*MOT:	and then years later you know she actually became famous you know.
*MOT:	what was that Mad_About_You was the show she was in.

*INV:	                       ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	(be)cause I don't like cake.
*MOT:	and then and actually my my stepson he's six and he's like really ambivalent about it himself.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	let's go to Baskin_Robbins and we'll pick you out an ice cream cake for your birthday.

	out of ice cream⌉.
*INV:	                                                 ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I was like okay you know.

*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and I was like oh my god you have to be kidding me.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and she was like no, we probably shouldn't put the pictures in the book if we don't have (th)em.
*MOT:	and I'm like you think?
*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*MOT:	yeah (be)cause there's little kids out here.

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].

*MOT:	she was like that's right.
*MOT:	I'll do it.
*MOT:	I'll go I'll find it.

*MOT:	and they said yeah we have it.
*MOT:	and I said okay good.
*MOT:	let's do it.
*MOT:	he's gonna flip out if we don't have it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so, that's my cake saga story I guess for the moment.
*MOT:	most particularly vanilla cake is my &=makes:face.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	xxx that but.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	I like ice cream too.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	they seem to go together.
*MOT:	I don't know why.
*MOT:	I like ice cream though.
*MOT:	but that reminds me of my aunt.
*MOT:	she's so cute.
*MOT:	she's not really my aunt ⌈she's my great aunt⌉.
*INV:	                         ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and uh I was at her house in Maine, and um we just I don't know how we came to this conversation you know of Brier's ice cream.
*MOT:	and I said you know what?
*MOT:	I think say what you will, but I think they make the best vanilla
	ice cream going.
*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*MOT:	and she's like really?
*MOT:	and I love their vanilla ice cream.
*MOT:	and then the next time I went to visit I was only stopping over night.
*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I was with Firstname and her house is about three hours from my mom's house but you you hit there first.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so I said we'll get to Firstname's house and we'll spend the night
	there ⌈and then we'll go on to Firstname's house the next day⌉.
*INV:	      ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	and so we get there and open the freezer and there's like a full
	gallon ⌈of that ice cream⌉.
*INV:	       ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	and she's like well I bought that for you dear.
*MOT:	you said that you liked it.
*MOT:	and I said I know but I'm only gonna be here for one day you know.
*MOT:	I don't need quite that much.
*MOT:	and I appreciate it but next time I leave remind me to tell you how
	much I'd like to have a Porsche.
*MOT:	so that the next time I stop by you know.
*MOT:	who knew?
*MOT:	so, that's what that reminds me of but.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	about it for cake I guess.
@G:	Elephant
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	we're back to the zoo with the elephant.
*MOT:	and for some reason the first thing that came to my mind was I wonder how them elephants are doin(g).
*MOT:	there was a whole big news story ⌈like a while ago about the
	Eeephants at the Detroit_Zoo⌉.
*INV:	                                 ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and for their own you know they weren't doing well or something so they were trying to move them um to some elephant habitat you know in southern California.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	where they'd have more room and they'd have you know what I mean?
*MOT:	something closer to their ⌈actual natural habitat⌉.
*INV:	                          ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	and then there was a bunch of fighting about it and I can't remember why.
*MOT:	and then they finally said yes this would be moving day.
*MOT:	and then they were like you know we are hoping to move them today.
*MOT:	you know on the news people were like why do you say hoping?
*MOT:	and they're like if an elephant doesn't want to move, guess what?
*MOT:	so we just do our best you know.
*MOT:	today is the day we planned it and we're gonna try to ease (th)em that way but if they don't wanna go they're not going.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so, but I do feel bad for elephants.
*MOT:	like in the circus and stuff.
*MOT:	you see the ones that that go bonkers.
*MOT:	and sometimes I think you know gosh.
*MOT:	can't really blame (th)em.
*MOT:	you know?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and so now I have the the circus though now.
*MOT:	I've seen too many of those crazy videos.
*MOT:	so now I have this like probably unnatural fear of taking my child
	to the circus ⌈incase an animal goes berserk you know⌉.
*INV:	              ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*MOT:	but I don't know.
*MOT:	I guess that's all, parental paranoia that you have to have a kid to develop all these strange and bizarre fears of things like that but.
*INV:	go ahead ⌈and say a little bit more⌉?
*MOT:	but I I like ⌊elephants⌋.
*MOT:	they're cool.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	they're cool.
*MOT:	and I saw a whole thing on um um elephants like on the Discovery_Channel.
*MOT:	they're actually one of the few animals that do completely morn the
	death ⌈of a not their mates but their tribe or I don't know what
	they call them⌉.
*INV:	      ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	their group.
*MOT:	and the leader of the elephant family is always female.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and um she will lead it until the day that she dies and they when she does they the rest of them will have a really hard time with it.
*MOT:	and they say you can actually see it.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and you can practically hear them.
*MOT:	you know what I mean?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and they will go back to where she was and they will you know what I mean.
*MOT:	and they do, remember I guess.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	forever.
*MOT:	who she was and where she was and and to follow her lead.
*MOT:	it's really cool.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	cool animal.
*INV:	alright.
*INV:	anything else you'd like to say?
*MOT:	I think that's it.
*INV:	okay.
*INV:	great.

*INV:	that was such a big help.
