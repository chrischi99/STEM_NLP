*MOT:	and the I don't understand the bullet.
*MOT:	well I guess you know yeah I guess bullets.
*INV:	uh huh.

*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	okay that's just about it.

*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um.
*INV:	can you say a little bit more?
*MOT:	and did you know that turtles have sharp claws?
*MOT:	I didn't really realize that they had sharp claws.
*INV:	mm, mm-hm mm-hm [= filler].

*MOT:	I don't know what the red is.
*INV:	okay great ⌈great⌉.
*MOT:	so         ⌊um⌋.
@G:	Cheese
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	this is cheese.
*MOT:	I would assume it's some sort of swiss cheese because it's got holes in it.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's a big wedge of cheese.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you know mou- mice like cheese.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	we like cheese a lot.
*MOT:	we eat cheese on almost everything.
*INV:	uh huh, uh huh.
*MOT:	uh cheese is high in calcium.
*MOT:	high in fat.
*INV:	yes.
*MOT:	probably high in calories but it's still a pretty good food for you to eat in moderation.
*INV:	mm-hm mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	is there anything else you can say?
*MOT:	um, well it's just a wedge of cheese probably cut from a big round.
*INV:	mm-hm mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and cheese is made from cow's milk.
*MOT:	or goat's milk.
*MOT:	sheep's milk.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	you know from animal milk.
*MOT:	and you make cheese from from that so.

@G:	Painter
*MOT:	okay, here's a lady and she's painting a picture of a tree.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	she's actually either taking a photograph or a or a some sort of um pre predrawing of of this tree that she's painting.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and she's wearing a smock so she doesn't get paint on her own clothes.
*INV:	uh huh.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	um she's missing her paints.
*MOT:	I don't know where they are.
*MOT:	but she obviously likes to paint or to to draw very realistically.
*MOT:	there's not very much you know I mean it's a very realistic portrayal of the tree.
*INV:	mm-hm mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um the tree growing on the rock which is a little bit of an anomaly.
*MOT:	but um perhaps she saw it and that's why she wanted to paint it.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um and obviously she wants to get the details right therefore she keeps the sketch or the the picture the photo at hand [?] so that she can paint it exactly how it really was.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and that would be my take.
*INV:	okay great.
@G:	Bread
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	here's a loaf of bread.
*MOT:	it looks like it's absolutely whole wheat bread.
*MOT:	it's not white bread.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you can see chunks of things in it.
*MOT:	it almost um it's not sliced and so perhaps it's a homemade piece of a homemade loaf of bread.
*INV:	mm [= yum].
*MOT:	yeah I know.
*MOT:	oh I can never get the ridge in my homemade bread.
*MOT:	so maybe she got it at a Great Harvest or something.
*MOT:	let's see, um the the heel is cut off.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	which is fine by me because I don't prefer the heels at all.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but um ⌈makes me think of lunch⌉.
*INV:	what   ⌊else⌋?
*MOT:	or a good slice of homemade bread for toast in the morning.
*MOT:	need some raspberry jam to go along with it.
*INV:	ooh.
*MOT:	there we go.
*MOT:	um, let's see bread with whole wheat bread it's high in fiber.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's good for your body.
*MOT:	got lots of B vitamins.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	it's got you know fiber.

*INV:	uh huh, anything else?
*MOT:	um no not really.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Puppy
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	okay it's a little puppy.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	a little brown puppy.
*MOT:	obviously very new.
*MOT:	it's not very big at all.
*MOT:	and he's got very much puppy features.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	with the big round head.
*MOT:	and the the bigger eyes.
*MOT:	and the the bigger forehead.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	don't any have any idea what kind of breed it is.
*MOT:	um but it's all brown.
*MOT:	including the eyes are brown.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	he looks very attractive he'd be very attractive to my little girls.
*MOT:	they've been begging me for a puppy every single day.
*INV:	aw.
*MOT:	and now I'm like we live in a two bedroom condo with three three girls.
*MOT:	I don't need another thing clogg-clogging up the small amount of home we have.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but um it's got a little bit it's got like a medium length of of of fur.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	it's not very like a short short hair or anything like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but not incredibly long.
*MOT:	um, and he looks kind of inquisitive or just not I mean not sad or anything like that.
*MOT:	just kind of looking and.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Ladybug
*MOT:	           ⌈okay here we got a ladybug⌉.
*INV:	and what's ⌊this⌋?
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	which I'm always concerned about now because they look a lot like Japanese beetles.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and I'm so afraid that we're gonna be picking up ladybugs and thinking you know they are.
*MOT:	and they're actually Japanese beetles.
*MOT:	and you get bitten or whatever.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but um before I ever heard of Japanese beetles I really liked ladybugs.
*MOT:	it reminds me of when I was a little little girl growing up.
*MOT:	we had a swing set and it seemed like one summer like the ladybugs like gathered up in groves.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	like just thick all the way around the bases of the swing set.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and it was the most amazing thing I'd seen in my entire life.
*INV:	ah wow.
*MOT:	it was really really cool.
*MOT:	and they were the bright red ones.
*MOT:	where sometimes you get the the orangy ones or whatever.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but it was really really cool.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	of course then my brother went out and took the magnifying glass to them.
*MOT:	but he was a trouble maker from the get go.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	but we definitely ladybugs are a big thing in our house even now.
*MOT:	and we like to whenever find (th)em we actually put (th)em in like little bowls or whatever.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	so the girls can look at them and play with them for a little while.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	it reminds me of when my oldest daughter whenever we would sing um,
	take the keys and lock her up locker up however that song would go
	my fair lady.
*MOT:	and she would always end it with my fair lady, bug.
*MOT:	she'd always have to add the bug part to it so.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	that's about it.
*MOT:	it's got four big spots that you can see right there.
*MOT:	and I guess I never realized it had some white there ⌈on the on the
	head or anything like that but⌉.
*INV:	                                                     ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Doctor
*INV:	and what's this?
*MOT:	this is a physician taking care of a child.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	in a hospital.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um looks like the doctor's either looking at time or maybe counting respirations or something.
*MOT:	the girl has a cast on her arm.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	she must have other problems otherwise she wouldn't be in the hospital just for a broken arm.
*MOT:	reminds me of my husband.
*MOT:	he's an orthopedic surgeon.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and so he's always dealing with broken bones ⌈and and stuff like
	that⌉.
*INV:	uh                                           ⌊huh⌋.
*MOT:	that makes me think (o)kay if she's dealing with bones why does she
	have a stethoscope cause he stopped using them his first year out of
	medical school.
*MOT:	let's see.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	um there's a chart in her hand.
*MOT:	the child doesn't look like they're in incredible pain but she just laying there.
*MOT:	maybe she's just watching the television that they have.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	let's see, she's, I don't know.
*MOT:	she's just maybe she's going around on her rounds ⌈and checking the
	children in the morning⌉.
*INV:	                                                  ⌊mm-hm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	in the pediatric ward or something like that.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	just looks like a pleasant physician that you'd want to deal with.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	she looks very kind.
@G:	Baby
*MOT:	here's a cute little baby.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	a little baby girl.
*MOT:	probably we're looking at maybe like two months old.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	very little.
*MOT:	probably hasn't even learned how to roll over or anything like that.
*MOT:	which makes me think why does she have all the stuffed animals around her.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but she looks awfully happy.
*MOT:	she's got so much hair for such a little baby.
*MOT:	you can see it sticking up.
*MOT:	all of mine had just you could tell that there was hair there but it never ever- it was like like fur covering it and that was it.
*INV:	aw.
*MOT:	it was really cute.
*MOT:	but I like the little dark-haired little baby.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and obviously a little girl (be)cause she's got flowers on her jumper there.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and uh she's old enough where she's getting fatter you can tell.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	she doesn't like face away.
*MOT:	she doesn't look like she's very old at all.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	old enough to know how to smile.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	very big smile.
*MOT:	can smile on demand now.
*MOT:	um probably smiling for one of her parents most likely.
*MOT:	to get that kind of smile out of her.
*MOT:	um laying on a it looks too big to be a crib so she's probably laying on her parents bed.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	or you know or a sibling's bed.
*MOT:	probably a sibling's (be)cause it's got stars on it and I don't
	know too many adults who have stars on their bed.
*MOT:	but um, she just looks very happy very healthy.
*INV:	                             ⌈anything else⌉?
*MOT:	she's right where she should ⌊be⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	and I can't think of anything else right now.
*INV:	okay okay.
@G:	Cookie
*MOT:	           ⌈okay⌉.
*INV:	and what's ⌊this⌋?
*MOT:	this looks like a cookie that someone's kind of broken almost in half but not quite.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	looks like perhaps it could be a chocolate chip cookie although
	it's a little but more pixalted than some of the other pictures.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um it reminds me of just the other day when my husband was baking
	chocolate chip cookies for the girls.
*MOT:	and our idea my idea of cookies with the kids is taking them off the tray.
*MOT:	the dough that's already preformed.
*MOT:	and the kids think that that's great.
*MOT:	but he decided to make homemade cookies with them and I watched him do it.
*MOT:	and I thought that's the reason that I don't.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	because it was licking fingers.
*MOT:	and it was throwing the wrong things in at the wrong time and stuff like that.
*MOT:	but it was certainly fun to watch and we got to have cookies about everyday last week.
*MOT:	um but it brings back good memories.
*INV:	aw.
*MOT:	this one looks like it could be a little bit more of a crisp cookie
	⌈than a than a chewy cookie with the crumbs and the way that it
	broke⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's what I've got it for it.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	it's a little small for a cookie.
*INV:	yeah.
*MOT:	I'd like it a little bit bigger.
*MOT:	but no and it almost looks like it might be a pre-bought like a store bought cookie or something.
*MOT:	because it's perfectly shaped.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	mine are never perfectly shaped.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	there ya go.
@G:	Carrot
*MOT:	here we go we got a carrot.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	you rarely see the long carrots anymore as opposed to baby carrots.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	baby carrots have ruled to world now which is fine because they taste a lot sweeter.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um yeah very rarely do you ever find full length carrots at the grocery stores anymore especially with the stems on (th)em I mean the leave on them.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	it reminds me of Bugs Bunny.
*MOT:	that's just growing up.
*MOT:	the full length carrot does.
*MOT:	um as my kids whenever we have carrots my kids that's actually they're that's one of the vegetables they eat frequently.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	they uh always talk about how carrots help you see better.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but you always have to dip it in ranch dressing or in some sort of dressing.
*MOT:	blue cheese in the other favorite.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	ranch and blue cheese.
*MOT:	and if you do that then they'll eat them till the cows come home.
*MOT:	give (th)em to them raw and they just want to think that they're the worst things in the world.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	they will not eat them cooked but if you eat (th)em raw which this is much better.
*MOT:	I remember as a kid we used to have carrots like this before they had baby carrots.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	and we used to eat them all the time.
*MOT:	and I would actually we would actually eat (th)em with um salt.
*INV:	huh.
*MOT:	and I think about that now just dipping them in salt.
*MOT:	that makes me grossed out.
*MOT:	but then again we used to make like butter and sugar sandwiches too so.
*MOT:	which is another thing that grosses me out now.
*MOT:	but that's what we got there for full length carrots so.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	um nope not on that one.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Baseball Player
*MOT:	here's a baseball player.
*MOT:	um don't know much about baseball.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but um, he's cartoonish so it's not like it's an actual picture.
*MOT:	but obviously he just swung the bat.
*MOT:	don't know if he you know hit it or not but he doesn't look upset so perhaps he hit the ball.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	this is definitely like the follow through.
*MOT:	it's not like the beginning of the swing it's the follow through
	⌈(be)cause the bat would be on the other side⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋, mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, he's very thin for a baseball player.
*MOT:	as the ones I've seen have been a little bit on the squatter side.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um no less powerful but he doesn't have huge guns so he's probably not the power hitter.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	uh, he doesn't look young.
*INV:	uh huh uh huh.
*MOT:	he looks to be a little bit on the older side.
*MOT:	but that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Pig
*MOT:	and here we've got a pig.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um I'm assuming it's a female because of the the I would assume with the the nipples there or whatever.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but um spotted.
*MOT:	it's not the first thing I think of when I think of a pig.
*MOT:	but I know that there are spotted pigs.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	the typical pig is just like all pink or whatever.
*MOT:	it seems like a nice size.
*MOT:	it's not a baby but probably more full grown.
*INV:	mm-hm, tell me more.
*MOT:	I think of Charlotte's web.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	it's really I do.
*MOT:	we just finished watching that the other day but.
*MOT:	but um yeah I do I think although this one looks like a female instead of a male.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	but um.
*INV:	anything else you can say?
*MOT:	mm, reminds me that I've got some pork chops in the freezer that I need to cook up.
*MOT:	that's about it.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Duck
*MOT:	here's a duck.
*MOT:	it looks like he's a mallard duck.
*MOT:	I think these kinds of mallard ducks are males.
*MOT:	with the coloring like that.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	um, reminds me of a pond when we were in a school [?] in Wisconsin that always had the Canadian geese and these mallard ducks all over the place and you didn't want to get close because the ducks were fine but the geese were just evil.
*MOT:	and always wanted to chew your hands off.
*MOT:	they'd chase you if you had any kind of food.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um it reminds me of even growing up where we'd go to the to the zoo.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and we'd always bring a big bag of like grocery sized bag of paper bag of popcorn.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	to throw into the there was bridge to go over the lake to go over
	this lake ⌈to get to the zoo⌉.
*INV:	          ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	and we'd always just throw popcorn over.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and let the ducks eat it.
*MOT:	that was that was a lot of fun.
*INV:	oh.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little more.
*MOT:	uh the coloring is distinct.
*MOT:	I always liked the the the bright iridescent green, ⌈heads⌉.
*INV:	                                                    ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	and thought the females got a raw deal with their brown feathers.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	but no I like it and the little color there.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	and it's very pleasing, duck to look at so.
*INV:	mm-hm mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Banana
*MOT:	and here's a banana.
*MOT:	already peeled.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	perfect condition.
*MOT:	there's no brown on it.
*MOT:	no green.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um we like bananas in our house.
*MOT:	it seems like anytime I buy them the kids will eat half of it and throw the other half away.
*MOT:	it drives me nuts.
*MOT:	I know I always have a hard time paying for bananas but they're
	obviously- it it makes me laugh  because I buy bananas at the store
	and think forty nine cents a pound but then think it's the cheapest
	fruit ⌈in the grocery store⌉.
*INV:	uh    ⌊huh⌋.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	so I don't know why I have a hard time paying for them.
*MOT:	but they do turn fast at at our house.
*MOT:	um we like to make banana bread.
*MOT:	we make banana bread a lot but only when they get a lot a lot browner.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	um and my oldest daughter will eat the banana bread morning noon and night until it's gone.
*MOT:	so do I so I try not to make it very often because you have to add a lot of oil to it.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	uh let's see, um bananas high in potassium.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	let's see um +...
*INV:	say a little bit more.
*MOT:	monkeys like bananas.
*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*MOT:	that's the typical thing to think.
*MOT:	um one of the first foods you actually typically give a baby.
*INV:	uh huh uh huh.
*MOT:	they're very easy for them to eat and sweet.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	I know any baby food that has banana added to it my children loved.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	anything else was, iffy.
*MOT:	and nope this looks like the perfect banana right here.
*INV:	uh huh.
*MOT:	okay.
*INV:	anything else you can say or?
*MOT:	no that's about it.
*INV:	okay great.
*INV:	thank you so much.
