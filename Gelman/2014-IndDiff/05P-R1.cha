*MOT:	a monarch maybe.
*MOT:	I don't know much about butterflies.
*INV:	tell me more.

*INV:	tell me a little bit ⌊more⌋.

@G:	Old Woman
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	an older person.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, maybe kind of, I don't know if esoteric is the right word.
*MOT:	she has an interesting bead necklace and like a decorated cane and heavy pants.
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	um, nothing really.
*MOT:	her hair is interesting because it's longer.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	you don't often see, older women usually cut their hair short but.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	it looks like it's in braids or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], anything else?
*MOT:	so, if you were going to take it a stretch and put all the stereotypes in she could be Native American with braids in her hair and beads.
*INV:	                          ⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	but that would be kind of ⌊stereotypical⌋.
*MOT:	it wasn't the first thing I thought of.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Firefighter
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a fireman.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, I guess that's the fire over there.
*MOT:	it's kind of like a water color, smudgy.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	um, I've never seen a fireman at work.
*MOT:	it's kinda interesting.
*MOT:	I didn't know they dangled the hose over the ladder.
*MOT:	um, the smudgy fire kind of reminds me of a painting I saw
	yesterday, ⌈that was just somebody throwing uh I think it was water
	balloons filled with paint at a canvas⌉.
*INV:	           ⌊mm-hm [= yes]⌋.
*INV:	                 ⌈wow⌉.
*MOT:	I guess that was ⌊sharper⌋.

*MOT:	&=shakes:head_no.
*INV:	⌈okay⌉.
*MOT:	⌊no⌋.
@G:	Pineapple

*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	I really like fruit.
@G:	Muffin
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a muffin.
*MOT:	probably a blueberry muffin.
*MOT:	with crumbly oatmeal stuff on top.
*MOT:	                              ⌈xxx⌉ +...
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit ⌊more⌋.
*MOT:	doesn't look very appetizing.
*MOT:	looks kinda dried out.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	and the paper looks stuck to it.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	but I would still eat it if it was in front of me.
@G:	Judge
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	um, a judge.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	um, he's black.
*MOT:	I don't think there's a lot of, well you know, probably not proportionally a lot of black people who are judges compared to other people.
*MOT:	um I've been in a class recently about African American legal history.
*INV:	wow.
*MOT:	so it made me think of that class.
*MOT:	he has his glasses off and he has a kinda skeptical look on his face so I I think he's hearing a tall story.
*INV:	tell me more.
*MOT:	um, he doesn't look very um tolerant of nonsense with that expression on his face.
*INV:	sure, okay.
*MOT:	so.
@G:	Ice Cream
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	ice cream.
*MOT:	pink ice cream.
*MOT:	um so probably strawberry but bubblegum, anything else.
*MOT:	waffle cone which I'd never seen before I came to this country.
*MOT:	we just had cake cones ⌈so very different kinds of cones⌉.
*INV:	                       ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	I don't really like cones.
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	um this here looks like, I don't know some parts of it look kind of melted like there's a kind of rivulet or something.
*MOT:	but then there it looks really sharp so.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it's not really a melting ice cream cone.
*MOT:	but maybe the scoop was warm or something.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Skunk
*INV:	  ⌈what is this⌉?
*MOT:	a ⌊skunk⌋.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	there's a skunk who comes around by our house.
*INV:	uh oh.
*MOT:	um, and they smell.
*MOT:	but I guess they don't smell all the time.
*MOT:	the first thing I can think of is a Myth_Busters episode I saw, about gettin rid of skunks' smell.
*MOT:	um, I don't really know anything about skunks.
*MOT:	there's one in <um> [?], there's a cartoon xxx [= cartoon name].
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so that's what I think of when I see the skunk.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little more.
*MOT:	um, it looks like it's in a defensive posture.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	um, it's kind of, I don't know that might just be the proportions of its body but it looks like it's kinda crouched ready to spring.
*MOT:	although I don't think that skunks really spring but ⌈this one⌉, this
	one could.
*INV:	                                                     ⌊okay⌋.
*MOT:	and um it has its tail up which, I don't really know if they always have their tails up.
*MOT:	I think they have curly tails.
*MOT:	but I suppose it could be gettin ready to spray if it has its tail up.
*MOT:	but it's also facing whatever it is that, is threatening it so.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	xxx skunk.
@G:	Pumpkin
*INV:	⌈what is this⌉?
*MOT:	⌊pumpkin⌋!
*MOT:	it's a very long tall pumpkin.
*MOT:	probably quite heavy.
*MOT:	um, good for makin(g) jack_o_lanterns.
*INV:	what else?
*MOT:	um, it's very orange and shiny.
*MOT:	I kinda wonder if they wax them or something or if they ⌈skin
	naturally is waxed somehow or shiny⌉.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	but yeah it's, tall.
*INV:	anything ⌈else⌉?
*MOT:	<about   ⌊oh> [?]⌋.
*MOT:	about the pumpkin no.
*MOT:	just it's probably not very tasty to eat.
*MOT:	I tried buying a whole bunch of pumpkins once and cooking them.
*MOT:	they weren't very good.
*INV:	okay.
@G:	Cat
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a cat.
*MOT:	um it just looks cute and fluffy.
*MOT:	um, yeah it just looks cute and ⌈fluffy⌉.
*INV:	tell me a little                ⌊more⌋.
*MOT:	um it's moving somewhere.
*MOT:	it's in a moving posture.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um maybe its tail is swinging from side to side.
*MOT:	but um, I kind of associate cats' tails swingin(g) side to side with them being mad.
*MOT:	but it doesn't really look mad.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	and I think cats might do that anyway.
*INV:	alright.
*MOT:	so.
@G:	Parrot
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a parrot, probably.
*MOT:	it could be a parakeet.
*MOT:	I don't know the difference.
*MOT:	parrot, um, it's really fluffy looking as well.
*MOT:	um, kinda looks comical almost I don't know why.
*MOT:	but something about it is comical.
*MOT:	um I suppose it could be saying something.
*INV:	go ahead and say a little bit more.
*MOT:	um, I don't know how you if you can tell if the wings are clipped or not.
*MOT:	but I suppose it's quite content on its perch.
*MOT:	um, it looks intelligent.
*MOT:	obviously has an intelligent expression in its eyes.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	xxx &=whispers.
*INV:	anything else?
*MOT:	not really it's just really fluffy.
*MOT:	it looks like you [?] expect it to look more sleek than ruffled but
	this one has soft downy fluffy looking feathers, ⌈as opposed to long
	sleek ones⌉.
*INV:	                                                 ⌊okay⌋.
*MOT:	but that's, yep that's about it.
*INV:	alright.
*MOT:	is there one more?
@G:	Cracker
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a cracker.
*MOT:	a saltine cracker.
*INV:	tell me a little more.
*MOT:	um, they're really really salty.
*MOT:	um, this one looks pretty much like an average cracker.
*MOT:	you can't see the salt crystals on it.
*MOT:	um, even though it looks whole I get the sense it might be half (be)cause I think they come in twos.
*MOT:	you usually see them in twos.
*MOT:	and it has kinda serrated, well not serrated but just the the edge is different there.
*MOT:	um, that's about it.
*MOT:	it's very yellow.
*MOT:	I wonder why they're always that color.
*MOT:	if they put things in it, to make it that color or whether just the box or whatever makes it that color.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	that's all.
*INV:	alright, thank you.
*MOT:	you're welcome.
