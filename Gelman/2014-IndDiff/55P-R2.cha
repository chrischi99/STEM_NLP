*INV:	mm-hm [= filler].
*INV:	anything more?
*MOT:	no.
*INV:	okay good.
@G:	Judge

*MOT:	that's kind of unusual.
*MOT:	but I guess maybe if you're used to walking in them it wouldn't be a big deal to walk in them.
*MOT:	I'm thinking if you're walking with a cane you'd want very comfortable stable shoes.
