*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	it's a pirate.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and uh &=laughs, I have three little boys ⌈so uh our world is full
	of pirates⌉.
*INV:	                                          ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*MOT:	so it's a very funny picture to start with.
*INV:	            ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	yeah um you ⌊know⌋.
*INV:	what more can you tell me?
*MOT:	my uh six year-old, ⌈uh loves Treasure_Island⌉.
*INV:	                    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so this we've read that book ⌈I don't even know how many times⌉.
*INV:	                             ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so &=laughs we've read it a lot.
*INV:	                                     ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	there's sort of a smaller version of ⌊it⌋.
*MOT:	but it's uh, is it was a little older than what I had, wanted for him I think.
*MOT:	but he got it at a book fair at school.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so it was this short version.
*MOT:	and gosh we I think I read that six times you know?
*MOT:	I'm so tired of reading about the pirates.
*MOT:	but he loved it.
*MOT:	and so he absolutely loves pirates.
*MOT:	and he loves gold was their [?] favorite color for a really long
	time because of gold and pirates and ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	I mean so yeah so, the two kids just really liked gold.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and uh yeah ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	can you say a little ⌊more⌋?
*MOT:	uh, yeah I don't, I don't know.
*MOT:	it was their, you know pirates just make me think I guess about the
	fantasy world that the kids play in, ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	                                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause there's always something that they're making up or, uh imagining.
*MOT:	and um, makes me think too of the, we saw, when I was a kid we saw Swiss_Family_Robinson.
*MOT:	my mom ⌈took us to that⌉.
*INV:	       ⌊oh⌋, mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and it was actually in the theater at that time which makes me feel really really really old.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	but um, and uh, I'm hoping that that was not the first edition of that by the way.
*MOT:	(be)cause I think about it I think good night.
*MOT:	that was a, that just makes me really old.
*MOT:	but, this I must be old because they did uh, it was a double
	feature, ⌈with Swiss_Family_Robinson and the Apple_Dumpling_Gang⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	oh really?
*MOT:	and it musta been a really really really hot day because we watched both shows.
*MOT:	and then I know we stayed for at least one more.
*MOT:	(be)cause they used to let you stay in the theater and, ⌈to watch
	the shows after the shows⌉.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I mean it was if you're in the building it seemed like you could stay and watch another one.
*MOT:	so we watched, I think we watched Swiss_Family_Robinson twice.
*MOT:	I don't think we watched the Apple_Dumpling_Gang twice.
*MOT:	but, just seems like boy my mother musta had enough that day, where
	she just felt like tv is good or, or movies are good, ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	                                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so yeah that was that was many many hours of, of xxx.
*MOT:	I guess not television but movies.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it was very funny.
*MOT:	so yeah the um, yeah, uh I guess the other thing about that just makes me think of of hero play.
*MOT:	you know the kids are always playing uh, you know getting being the good guy getting away from the bad guy.
*MOT:	and every once in awhile they'll wanna be the bad guy.
*INV:	        ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and you ⌊know⌋, um it's interesting how they it's interesting
	watching them play those games, you know so, ⌈anyway⌉.
*INV:	                                             ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I always want them to be the good guy of course but you know you just have to you just have to let it happen.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so, at least if they fantasize about being the guy good bad guy maybe they'll be the good guy in real life, you know?
*INV:	⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	⌊so⌋, but <I ended up> [?] be done with this one.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	not to +...
*INV:	sure.
*MOT:	I don't know if I have anything else to say about that.
@G:	Banana
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	that's a banana.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it's what my two year-old eats every morning so um.
*INV:	mm-hm what else ⌈can you tell me⌉?
*MOT:	I'm allergic to ⌊bananas⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	so I don't eat them myself.
*MOT:	I shouldn't say I'm allergic to (th)em.
*MOT:	I'm if they look like this, ⌈sort of okay with it⌉.
*INV:	                            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	um, they ⌈have to be well it's funny⌉, not to +...
*INV:	         ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	this looks uh, the peel looks yellower than the banana looks, ⌈to
	me⌉.
*INV:	                                                              ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	not that that matters at all.
*MOT:	I'm sure that's not the point of this but, um.
*MOT:	but for me if it's too ripe a fruit I'm allergic to it.
*MOT:	⌈so whenever bananas get kinda brown then I tend to not be able to
	eat it (be)cause it makes me my face itch⌉.
*INV:	⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I also like to get them outa the house as quickly as &=laughs as possible.
*MOT:	but my two year-old loves (th)em.
*INV:	      ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so he ⌊eats⌋ (th)em all the time.
*MOT:	so yeah I mean it's a good nutritional food.
*MOT:	it's good potassium.
*INV:	               ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	all those good ⌊things⌋.
*MOT:	monkeys eat (th)em.
*MOT:	kids like monkeys, you know so.
*MOT:	it's uh, yeah, ⌈one of those things⌉.
*INV:	can you tell me ⌊more⌋?
*MOT:	uh, you know what my nose is kind of running.
*INV:	                       ⌈oh sure⌉.
*MOT:	would you can I have a ⌊tissue⌋?
*INV:	⌈absolutely⌉.
*MOT:	⌊sorry⌋.
*INV:	sorry about that.
*MOT:	allergies.
*MOT:	nope I think I'm speaking of allergies maybe it triggered that, no.
*MOT:	um, thank you um.
*INV:	you're welcome.
*MOT:	you know they grow in bunches.
*INV:	                   ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	they don't grow by ⌊themselves⌋.
*MOT:	so, there we go.
*MOT:	there's a family analogy.
*MOT:	they um they they they they cannot thrive by themselves.
*MOT:	they have to be with a group, ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	                              ⌊mm-hm⌋, okay.
*MOT:	that's what I know about bananas.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	oh and there's a funny Sesame_Street.
*INV:	mm.
*MOT:	um, I don't remember the song now.
*MOT:	uh, if I had a minute I'd think about it.
*MOT:	but there's a really funny Sesame_Street.
*MOT:	and that's what makes me think of the bunches.
*MOT:	(be)cause it's a it's a silly Sesame_Street, ⌈song about⌉, um banana
	families, ⌈you know⌉, so.
*INV:	                                             ⌊mm-hm⌋, ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	but it talks about them ⌈not being able to⌉, grow on their own.
*INV:	                        ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	                                  ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	you know they need their families ⌊so⌋, you know.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	⌊maybe⌋ [?] that's where that comes from.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	anyway.
@G:	Pig
*INV:	what is this?
*MOT:	a pig.
*INV:	         ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	very big ⌊pig⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	makes me think of Wilbur.
*MOT:	you know because of course we have Charolotte's_Web, ⌈and have read
	that a couple of times⌉.
*INV:	                                                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and uh, it also makes me think of um, makes me think of how the
	kids are asking asking questions about meat lately, you know which I
	think is really interesting.
*MOT:	like Mom what kind of meat is that, and, I sort of feel a little
	funny saying well it's pig or ⌈cow or you know⌉.
*INV:	                              ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	(be)cause what they associate is this &=points:at_picture you know?
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	then you talk to them about what they're eating.
*MOT:	you know and they're trying to figure it all out and.
*INV:	                             ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	then I start to think ew and ⌊I⌋, you know?
*MOT:	like, why am I eating this?
*MOT:	and I start to try to figure it all out because ⌈we've been talking
	for years you don't really talk farm animals⌉, you know.
*INV:	                                                ⌊right⌋.
*INV:	                                      ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and I think your for your early adult ⌊life⌋.
*MOT:	and all of a sudden you have children and you're what's a cow say you know, what's a pig say?
*MOT:	and there's you know and they're being very cute the kids and oinking and whatever.
*MOT:	and uh, and then you start to reassociate it again with what you're eating everyday.
*INV:	    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and ⌊um⌋, so yeah, so it's interesting.
*MOT:	but I'm not gonna become a vegetarian or anything you know.
*MOT:	but it does make you kinda think oh hm, um.
*INV:	I'd like to hear more what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	uh, this is um, we're always talking farm animals, ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	                                                   ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and I have a my two year-old.
*MOT:	uh, he's at that stage where you're you're asking him all the
	animals you know, what does it say ⌈so⌉.
*INV:	                                   ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and the kids will then act things out which is funny so you know.
*MOT:	to help him I think you know.
*MOT:	um, (be)cause the kids are six and four and then two.
*MOT:	so the six and four year-old are trying to, teach the two year-old which is fun.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and Firstname is now uh, figuring out how to read the three-letter words.
*INV:	                                          ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	so it's really fun to kinda work with him ⌊and⌋.
*MOT:	you know there's, I don't know another story that's, I don't
	remember [= whispering] Mig the Pig I think or something you know.
*INV:	                    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and they're all the ⌊rhyming⌋, you know mig pig jig, you know.
*MOT:	and so he's starting to learn to do those read those things.
*MOT:	and uh, and that's fun.
*INV:	       ⌈oh⌉ +...
*MOT:	but um ⌊yeah⌋ I don't know.
*MOT:	I don't think I have anything else other than, ⌈like [?] I said⌉, pig
	stories.
*INV:	                                               ⌊okay⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes], that's alright.

@G:	Ladybug
*MOT:	oh ladybugs.
*MOT:	ladybugs.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I know they're supposed to be cute.
*MOT:	they aren't cute when you end up with hundreds of them all over your
	side of your ⌈house you know⌉.
*INV:	             ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	they lose cuteness very quickly.
*MOT:	&=laughs.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	so I'm not really into lady +...
*MOT:	you know it's pretty funny, (be)cause all the girly stuff you know
	since we have boys all boys it's very ⌈interesting all the girl
	stuff has little ladybugs on it⌉.
*INV:	                                      ⌊oh⌋.
*MOT:	<which is> [?] really cute.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	then the reality is you know the early spring or late fall you get them all over the side of your house.
*INV:	                         ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and you're scraping them ⌊off⌋.
*INV:	ew.
*MOT:	it's just such a huge bummer.
*MOT:	but just they're just so not cute anymore, you know?
*MOT:	yeah it's really a bummer.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	yeah I didn't really care until I had so many of them.
*MOT:	and we don't we haven't we've had more of the other bugs lately.
*MOT:	but oh boy I remember a couple years ago we just had a ton of them.
*MOT:	that was a huge bummer.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	see I don't like bugs.
*MOT:	I've just come to decide that I really +...
*MOT:	doesn't even matter if they're kinda cute with red and little black things on them.
*MOT:	I don't really like them so, you know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, so yeah the kids find them, you know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and uh I'm always encouraging them to get rid of them for me.
*MOT:	so xxx &=laughs so why don't you go ahead and take care of that for me.
*MOT:	so I throw that one outside.
*MOT:	okay [= speaking like child].
*MOT:	and they're off and running you know.
*MOT:	so, it's good.
*INV:	                          ⌈oh⌉.
*MOT:	<it's still> [?] good for ⌊that⌋.
*MOT:	and uh yeah, ⌈very funny⌉.
*INV:	go           ⌊ahead⌋ and say a little bit more.

*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	or do they eat them?
*INV:	you know I'm not sure.
*MOT:	okay I don't know.
*MOT:	I don't I thought, I thought they were sort of good for some, gardening or plants or something.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	like they have to be good for something.
*MOT:	(be)cause it seems like somebody used to, didn't people import them
	into the country for something or export them somewhere or something?
*MOT:	I don't ⌈know⌉.
*INV:	        ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	I know.
*MOT:	when I worked at uh Fed_Ex in college ⌈there were it was very
	strange actually but I think it was sort of interesting⌉.
*INV:	                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	they would we would have a box of ladybugs that would come through periodically.
*MOT:	and I think that farmers or somebody used them.
*MOT:	and I don't know who uses them.
*MOT:	but we'd have a box with like say live ladybugs or alive whatever.
*INV:	                          ⌈oh really⌉?
*MOT:	and it'd have this little ⌊screen⌋ on there ⌈that um you'd  like
	look inside⌉.
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	<I mean> [?] you could see inside and there was like, I mean
	thousands ⌈of them in a box⌉.
*INV:	oh        ⌊my⌋.
*MOT:	and you're just thinking, bleh.

*INV:	        ⌊right⌋.
*INV:	                                                       ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	so I don't know I don't know what the I don't know what they didn't
	say farmer on the box but I don't know what the cause was.
*MOT:	but it um so I don't know if they destroy crops or if they help crops.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but they you know that was that's my other memory of bugs, ⌈um⌉.
*INV:	                                                           ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*INV:	                                 ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*INV:	                                                               ⌊wow⌋.
*MOT:	I mean and, ⌈for um⌉, for being so young you know I try not to brag

*INV:	            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	                                   ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and to have the coordination where you could throw that to (th)em
	and they hit the ball and it goes +...
*MOT:	and I mean, you know basically now I make one of them stand over
	there and the other one goes over there and I throw it to them and
	the other one goes and gets it.
*MOT:	you know because it's a, now I worry about my house, you know.
*MOT:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	because I just know ⌈that it's gonna hit my window you know⌉?

*INV:	                                ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and it's helped I mean that they can hit the ball and that they can throw it and catch it.
*MOT:	and it's really fun to see the children do it together.
*MOT:	you know ⌈(be)cause they both have mits and so they'll stand out
	there and play catch with each other⌉.
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and um, and it's an activity that we can do with them.
*INV:	                    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you know because we ⌊had⌋ that's why we started teaching the four
	year-old how to throw it up and hit it himself is because you can
	only play so much baseball you know?
*INV:	                       ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	I mean there are times ⌊when⌋ you get a little tired of throwing the
	ball to them and picking it up and all those other things.
*MOT:	but it was an activity that we can play with them.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and it's an activity that once you once they learn how to throw it
	up in the air and hit it by on their own, or once they learn how to
	you know have the mit and throw the ball up in the air and catch it
	on their own, ⌈then it's it keeps them interested⌉.
*INV:	              ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and it's something that we can do together.

*MOT:	show them team ⌊work⌋, you know?

	because you're not always up, ⌈you know⌉?
*INV:	                              ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	like you're not always up and the ball's not always coming to you, you know?
*MOT:	so, you know, as far as playing the game ⌈I think that's what my
	husband thought was boring about it⌉.
*INV:	                                         ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*INV:	                                                   ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I think there just wasn't isn't enough action in it for my husband.
*MOT:	but I think it's good to teach the patience, for the kids.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	and it's fun and yummy to go to the ⌈I mean not to when you go to
	the ball game you get to get hotdogs⌉ ⌈and all that kind of stuff⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊oh⌋.

*MOT:	and you know Fievel and whatever else ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	                                      ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*INV:	                          ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so how so again the the mouse and the cheese thing.
*MOT:	this makes me think of Santa_Mouse.

*MOT:	(be)cause they never ⌊were⌋.
*MOT:	I mean we always had it in our mind.
*MOT:	it was just a little sooner than we imagined.
*MOT:	um, but actually the relationship to have children two they're all

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	the thing I think um, my husband and I actually we had the dog before the children were born.
*INV:	                                ⌈mm⌉.
*MOT:	and I think it was a good sorta ⌊precursor⌋ to us having children

	we needed to be able to um⌉ +...
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	they ya know dogs they need attention ya know.

*MOT:	not to ⌈um we have a neighbor dog who's always in our yard⌉.
*INV:	       ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and it drives me crazy ⌈because this dog doesn't get any attention

*MOT:	if I wanted a dog I'd have a dog.

*MOT:	so I sorta feel ⌊like⌋ it's it's frustrating to me um knowing that
	when I had a dog I really cared for the dog ⌈you know⌉.
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*INV:	           ⌈sure⌉.
*MOT:	and to you ⌊know⌋.
*MOT:	and so it's frustrating.
*MOT:	and it's hard to teach the children when you have this dog running
	around your yard all the ⌈time about caring for other animals⌉.
*INV:	                         ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so ya know (be)cause I'm like go away, you know?
*MOT:	um so yeah I um, yeah it's interesting.
*MOT:	but um anyway.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	(be)cause I think they know and I think they understand the difference.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, the, it you know I think it is the thing that I think was good for us was to teach us how to treat something well.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and something that was completely dependent upon us to feed it and take care of it and love it.
*MOT:	and that's now having the children to take care of them and love them and feed them and, ya know all of those things.
*MOT:	and I think it's fascinating because we had two cats and a dog.
*MOT:	and to watch all their little personalities were they were very
	funny to us ⌈ya know⌉?
*INV:	            ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and uh the things that they would do to torment each other and to play with each other and all those kinds of things.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and now we look at our children and say okay now you're this animal and you're this animal and you're this one.
*MOT:	because they're all doing the same kinds of things ⌈ya know⌉?
*INV:	                                                   ⌊right⌋.

*MOT:	the boys aren't that bad.

*INV:	                             ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	but um boys sort of hit each ⌊other⌋ and get over it ya know what I
	mean?
*MOT:	it's sort of they-not to we don't encourage anything.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	but they're ya know it's like they I think from what I've
	experienced they've uh seemed to physically do something get over it
	⌈and be done⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋, ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and              ⌊um⌋, anyway.
*MOT:	I think it's interesting that um, that I think we learned a lot of
	those things from our animals ⌈and now now we have children⌉.
*INV:	                              ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so, anyway.
*MOT:	the kids would love this puppy and they would be thrilled to play with it.

*MOT:	and then it would probably well I shouldn't say puppies have really sharp little claws.
*INV:	        ⌈hm⌉.
*MOT:	so they ⌊probably⌋ wouldn't like it after that.
*MOT:	you know once you kinda puppies, when they're puppies ⌈have that um

*INV:	                                           ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.

*MOT:	so it's ya know so that to me is the other end of that sort of cookie factor.
*INV:	  ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	it's like there's all kinds of other relational things that you
	⌊see⌋ out in the world and ya know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	you do your best with your own family and what you think is right but wow you know?
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	it's uh, I don't know.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	so anyway you just gotta do what you gotta do.
*INV:	alright.
@G:	Painter
*MOT:	so, ⌈painting⌉.
*INV:	what is ⌊this⌋?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um, well she has a postcard she's painting, the postcard ⌈which is
	interesting⌉.
*INV:	                                                         ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um +...
*INV:	what else can you tell me?
*MOT:	the older I get the more I think that I might be interested in painting which is funny.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	but I think that's um, I feel like I'm silly but the uh, I think
	I've said those things several times so I need to change my language
	on that.
*MOT:	but the uh well it makes me feel like it kinda goofy (be)cause I
	like but somebody must like them so they must have (th)em on the tv
	for that.
*MOT:	do you ever watch those painting shows?
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	the guy's sittin(g) there ya know with the, afro the seventies fro
	and he's on there and he's painting and he's like it's so simple ya
	know.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	xxx and you just think, wow, ⌈it looks really simple⌉, ⌈maybe I
	should try that you know⌉?
*INV:	                             ⌊mm-hm⌋,          ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*MOT:	and then I think you're around your children and you're seeing what
	they're doing and you're encouraging them and +...
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and you see this painting show and the guy just sort of um, shows
	you, the detail of things that you don't see, ⌈ya know⌉.
*INV:	                                              ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	and I think that's the thing with the painting is that, I think
	there was a lot of detail that I didn't see until you or at least
	for me until I got to be in my thirties or I got to be wherever I am
	⌈along the path you know⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I think at every age and every generation or every whatever that you
	go through you start to see things differently and I think now I
	have more patience to be able to see something or to to find out
	what, what it took to create the tree on the paper.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	ya know like what what it took to um, make it make sense.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	you know and make it look like what you want it to look like.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I think it's a lot of different layers of um, of creating something.
*MOT:	you know, like you can't just put brown on there ⌈and you can't just
	put green on there ya know⌉, and imagine it to look like a tree.

*MOT:	and I think now that I might be able to see it a little differently
	or see it a little bit, ⌈more clear which is kind of interesting.
*INV:	                        ⌊mm-hm⌋.

*MOT:	you know as you go through you ⌊world⌋ as you go through life
	little by little you start to see things better.
*INV:	       ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	or not ⌊better⌋.
*MOT:	I guess in more detail.
*MOT:	more life experience.
*MOT:	more whatever to be able to see it a little ⌈bit differently⌉.
*INV:	                                            ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	so.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	yeah, ⌈so anyway⌉.
*INV:	      ⌊okay⌋.
*MOT:	yeah that's what I think of when I think of her painting is this +...
*MOT:	but it's in it's also interesting to me that she's it's not a free drawing.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	it's her painting what she sees already.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	which is interesting too.
*MOT:	so I don't know.
*INV:	okay.
*MOT:	yeah, I don't know.
*INV:	that's alright.
*INV:	great.
@G:	Turtle
*MOT:	turtle.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	uh, I think my neuroses are coming out in this whole thing &=laughs.
*MOT:	like I'm kinda like that's why I guess I'm kind of ya know +...
*MOT:	I usually have very good things worth to say about myself (be)cause

*MOT:	we know what Franklin ⌈does for every step of the way⌉.
*INV:	                      ⌊right⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	um but I also know that turtles have uh, it's not E coli but isn't it salmonella or something?
*MOT:	they're ⌈sorta saying that in the news lately that you kinda they

*INV:	        ⌊hm⌋.
*INV:	oh ⌊really⌋?
*MOT:	so yeah.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	so since I'm a &=laughs <guess it's just the neuroses> [?] xxx.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	well I'm always feeling like you know you wanna um, like I said you wanna keep the kids safe.
*MOT:	pardon me my nose is ⌈really⌉, running again.
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	sure.
*MOT:	and the um, you know I don't I don't I don't wanna have the kids have salmonella.
*INV:	                                                 ⌈uh-huh [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so yeah so that kinda changes it for me a little ⌊bit⌋.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	as far as picking them up ⌈ya know⌉.
*INV:	                          ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	      ⌈um⌉.
*INV:	right ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	or having one as a pet.
*MOT:	because even the pets have them apparently.
*MOT:	so ⌈I didn't know that but even the pets not just the wild turtles⌉.
*INV:	   ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	but it's really fun to see turtles in their natural environment.
*MOT:	I like to see them over there or on l on a rock or even ⌈right in
	front of me look at it [= pretending to gesture to a turtle]⌉.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	but I really don't have a big interest in picking it up (be)cause, I
	also feel like ya know that's I don't know, people don't come over
	and pick me up randomly.
*INV:	               ⌈right right⌉.
*MOT:	not to like ya ⌊know⌋ I sorta feel like we need to leave it alone
	ya know?
*INV:	         ⌈uh-huh [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	like let ⌊it⌋, not freak it out, ya know?
*INV:	                ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	I mean and it's ⌊ok⌋ to look at it but I don't know.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	like I'd just be very against poking it or touching it or whatever.
*MOT:	just kinda look at it and leave it alone.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I'm sure my husband'd probably pick it up.
*MOT:	you know my my uh rope is much shor- much shorter ⌈than his rope as
	far as with kids⌉, the whole, &=laughs you know everything.
*INV:	                                                  ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].

*INV:	                     ⌈right⌉.
*MOT:	you know and I think ⌊moms⌋, &=laughs except the cookie mom.
*MOT:	but um but most, most moms tend to reel them in a little bit rather
	than just let them be, ⌈ya know⌉.
*INV:	right                  ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	at least from what I've found.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	and I think um, that ya know the turtles I guess I feel that way about too.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I uh, although I think they're really kinda cool.
*INV:	uh-huh [= yes].
*MOT:	and I think they're um, I think it's really interesting.
*MOT:	the the thing that I found with the children is that they're
	reading so much and learning so much that they remind me of the
	things that I've forgotten to think about, ⌈ya know⌉?
*INV:	                                           ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	like a turtle.
*INV:	                       ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	or or the history of a ⌊turtle⌋ or the tortoise or whatever the ya
	know +...
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	I think as you I go off into my world, I I don't, I haven't take the
	taken the time to be as fascinated by +...
*MOT:	like the books my child brings home from school ⌈are about wild
	horses or about um⌉, I don't even know what he's brought home lately.
*INV:	                                                ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	              ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	about uh wild ⌊cats⌋.
*MOT:	wild horses wild cats.
*MOT:	um, wolves.
*MOT:	you know all these different, creatures ⌈ya know⌉.
*INV:	                                        ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and and I find that I I mean I'm reading them all those stories so
	then it kinda reminds me oh I didn't know that or I did I would have
	never thought about that or I would have +...
*MOT:	it's totally different reading those things as an adult ⌈than it was
	as a kid⌉ ⌈ya know⌉.
*INV:	                                                        ⌊mm-hm⌋ ⌊mm-hm⌋ [= filler].
*MOT:	and uh I think it's a totally it's like the painting.
*MOT:	it's a totally different understanding of what the words actually
	mean I think ⌈as an adult versus as when I read them as a child⌉.
*INV:	             ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so even with a sense of a of a turtle I mean I can see this being in
	one of his books, ⌈um⌉, and learning all about a turtle.
*INV:	                  ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I would be very interested in a turtle.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but I don't automatically wanna go over and make one a pet.
*INV:	right.
*MOT:	ya know, so, I'd just like to leave them in the world.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	but anyway yeah ⌈and Franklin⌉.
*INV:	                ⌊okay⌋.
*MOT:	Franklin is a, ⌈a million stories &=turning:page⌉.
*INV:	I'd like to hear more what else can you tell ⌊me⌋?
*MOT:	well um, Franklin is a uh the +...
*MOT:	in the kids' stories ⌈they so often use little cute little creatures
	ya know⌉ ⌈and Franklin to be able to teach behavioral things⌉.
*INV:	                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and um, and I like Franklin for that.
*MOT:	I think that you know we have Franklin_Rides_His_Bike_and_Franklin
	ya know, um +...
*MOT:	there's a story about Franklin and him getting a Mother's_Day gift for his mom.
*MOT:	and there's a ⌈story about or ya know or⌉ +...
*INV:	              ⌊oh⌋.
*INV:	                                        ⌈uh-huh [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and there's there's all these different ⌊things⌋ about Franklin
	that are like he has a mom and a dad who care about him and then he
	ends up with a little baby sister at some point.
*INV:	                    ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	and you know it's I ⌊like⌋ that um like Bernstein_Bears or
	⌈whatever⌉.
*INV:	⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	there are all these sort of ⌈family um relational stories told
	through little characters⌉ ⌈that kids like ya know⌉?
*INV:	                            ⌊sure⌋.
*INV:	                           ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	and ⌈that that's nice it's good⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I think one of the, one of the things that I do a lot when I'm
	reading books to the kids is um, finding books that teach behaviors.
*MOT:	and if they aren't teaching behaviors that I agree with or approve
	on, ⌈we'll talk about it⌉.
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	ya know and ⌈if somebody's doing something they shouldn't be doing
	I'll ask⌉.
*INV:	            ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	do you think they should be doing that?
*MOT:	or ⌈ya know or even if it is something that's good do you think they
	should be doing that⌉, ⌈yeah and why⌉, and let's talk about it.
*INV:	   ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	                       ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	and ⌈that's it makes it um⌉ +...
*INV:	    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	I want them to think.
*MOT:	ya know I don't want them to just go through and exist.
*INV:	⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	⌊but⌋ ya know um which we all do at certain ⌈points⌉.
*INV:	                                            ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	but I think that ya know they're gonna go through so many different
	experiences and um, ya know I'm not always gonna be there.
*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	so it's important to really help read a lot of stories that help
	them understand about behavior so that they can make good wise
	choices, ⌈ya know⌉?
*INV:	         ⌊mm-hm⌋, ⌈mm-hm [= filler]⌉.
*MOT:	so that's what I'm always ⌊doing⌋ and that's what I guess Franklin
	is I think kinda good for that and, ⌈certainly other stories⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	oh the tortoise and the hare story, ⌈xxx⌉.
*INV:	                                    ⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	the tortoise and the hare I think I think if you could put together
	the qualities ⌈of the tortoise and put together the qualities of
	the hare what an amazing person you'd have⌉.
*INV:	              ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	or what an amazing creature ⌈you'd have⌉.
*INV:	                            ⌊hm⌋.
*MOT:	so yeah I mean ⌈(be)cause⌉, ya know the the hare isn't all bad.
*INV:	               ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].
*INV:	                   ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	he's just a little ⌊sassy⌋ ⌈ya know what I mean⌉?
*INV:	                           ⌊right⌋ ⌈right⌉.
*MOT:	he's just a                        ⌊little⌋ he's just a little +...
*MOT:	but he's he's a really fast creature ⌈ya know⌉?
*INV:	                                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*MOT:	so I mean if you just put sort of consideration and thought and um,
	you know determination and perseverance from ⌈that ya know and then
	continuing to just keep on going no matter what quality with a
	person who has that um enthusiasm and ability to get excited⌉ ⌈and
	the ability to ya know⌉ +...

*MOT:	I mean if just imagine, ⌈what kind of an amazing⌉ +...
*INV:	                        ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	                                ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	so it's kind of ya know talk to ⌊them⌋ about those kinds of things
	⌈ya know⌉.
*INV:	⌊right⌋.
*MOT:	to just imagine just imagine.
*INV:	                   ⌈uh-huh [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	you have all those ⌊qualities⌋, what you could do with yourself or
	⌈what you could do with your life or what you could do with
