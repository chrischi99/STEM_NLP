*MOT:	mm-hm [= yes].

*CHI:	will he will he decide me?
*MOT:	well probably not.
*CHI:	why?
*MOT:	you know he wouldn't decide you because judges don't usually decide
	if it's somebody they know if somebody they know comes into the
	courtroom.
*MOT:	they'll say I know this person, I can't make a fair judgement
	about him, “I know this person, I can't make a fair judgement
	about him”.
*MOT:	(be)cause they're supposed to be really fair.
*MOT:	and justjudge based on the law.
*MOT:	not based on anything they know.
*MOT:	so if he saw you ⌈he'd say oh that's Firstname⌉.
*CHI:	                 ⌊what [?]⌋.
*MOT:	he couldn't decide fairly.
