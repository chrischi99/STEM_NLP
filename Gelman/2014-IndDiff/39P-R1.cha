*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	(be)cause you know when a surfer lays on his surfboard and paddles his arms the shark thinks that he's a seal and eats him.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	yes I told my son that.
*MOT:	when you go in the ocean it's probably not a good idea to go paddling around on a little board because a sharks always think you're a seal and try to eat you.

*MOT:	and some sideburns.
*INV:	&=laughs.
*MOT:	so he this guy needs some work.
*MOT:	there's no question about it.
*MOT:	this is not husband material.
*MOT:	well he might be husband material as long as you can change him
	after you marry him &=laughs.
