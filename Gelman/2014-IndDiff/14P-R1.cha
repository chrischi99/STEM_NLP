*INV:	mm                 ⌊mm⌋.
*MOT:	one thing that was really cool was there in in I think it was I
	might might be getting my facts mixed up but I think it was in
	Australia and I thought it was a frog, but it could have been a
	snake.
*MOT:	um when the it bites its victim the victim um doesn't feel any pain.
*INV:	hm.
*MOT:	and then it ends up it ends up dying.
*INV:	                                  ⌈oh⌉ +...
*MOT:	and I can't remember what it dies ⌊from⌋.
*MOT:	probably (be)cause it, I <don't know notice> [?] a lot of them
	liquefy you know the the inside of the body type of ⌈thing⌉.
*INV:	                                                    ⌊uh-huh⌋ [= yes].

	that⌉.
*INV:	               ⌊mm-hm⌋.
*INV:	       ⌈mm-hm [= yes]⌉.
*MOT:	but it's just amazing that there is you know out there a natural

*INV:	mm-hm [= yes].
*MOT:	because it doesn't there you you feel absolutely nothing.
*INV:	oh.
*MOT:	and and that was.
*MOT:	I think it's in Australia.
*MOT:	I think it's a snake or something like that.
*MOT:	but they're really working to try to extract venom and see what they can you know do with it.
*MOT:	so for even like cancer patients and ⌈you know things like that⌉.
*INV:	                                     ⌊mm-hm⌋.
